<h1 title="">JEAN CRAIG GROWS&nbsp;UP</h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">1. A Telephone Call</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem to me, kids,&rdquo; said Kit in exasperation,
&ldquo;that when someone is trying to write, you might be
a little quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three at the end of the room paid no attention.
Tommy was so absorbed in trying to see over Doris&rsquo;
shoulder that he didn&rsquo;t realize he was losing his balance.
Perched on the back of the chair, he suddenly
toppled over and landed squarely in Doris&rsquo; lap. With
all the dignity of the eleven-year-old that he was, he
picked himself up and resumed his perch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it out, will you?&rdquo; protested Doris. &ldquo;You practically
killed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Jean was making plans for a party. The list of names
lay before her, and she tapped her pencil on her nose
thoughtfully as she eyed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, listen, Jean,&rdquo; Doris proposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an
idea. Why not roll up the living room rug and push
the furniture back out of the way, so that we can play
records and dance. We can ask all the kids who have
records to bring a few with them. That way we won&rsquo;t
have to keep playing our same old records over and
over. Don&rsquo;t you think that would be fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK. If we have plenty of cokes, potato chips, and
pretzels on hand, we won&rsquo;t need much else for refreshments,
do you think? Or should we have hamburgers
later, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get along without hamburgers, although
those boys will eat all they can get their hands on,&rdquo;
replied Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many do you have on your list?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten. With the four of us, that should be plenty
for a party. I still wonder if it&rsquo;s really wise to have one
with Mother bringing Dad home.&rdquo; The rest were
silent. Kit, sitting at her mother&rsquo;s desk beside the wide
bay window, looked up and frowned at the falling
snow that was obscuring the view of the Sound. A
pearly grayness seemed to be settling around the big
house as if it were being cut off from the rest of the
world by a thick, soft curtain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope Dad&rsquo;s feeling better by now,&rdquo; Kit said suddenly,
pushing her dark bangs back from her forehead
restlessly. &ldquo;They said they would be leaving the hospital
the eighth. Wasn&rsquo;t it the eighth, Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll be home in plenty of time,&rdquo; Jean exclaimed.
&ldquo;Here we all sit, looking like small, black
storm clouds when he&rsquo;s better. Mother said positively
in her last letter that he had improved wonderfully
during the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris stared at the long, low couch on one side of
the open fireplace. It was over four weeks since her
father had lain on it. Early the previous fall he had
come home after two and a half years in the Army.
During those years Mrs. Craig had managed to hold
her family together although it hadn&rsquo;t been easy with
four children. When they had received word that
Major Thomas Craig had been wounded in the Pacific,
they had all been worried. Later, he was well
enough to return to the States, and it was comforting
to have him nearer home. Finally, the Army Hospital
in Philadelphia had discharged him and he returned
to his family at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Through the winter there had been a steady decline
in his health until it was necessary for him to return
to the Army Hospital for possible further treatment.</p>
<p>Somehow Doris could not help wondering whether
the future would get any brighter. She rose quickly,
shaking her head defiantly at the thought, as any
thirteen-year-old girl would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not worry, kids. If we&rsquo;re all blue when he
comes, he&rsquo;ll have a relapse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jean spoke, anxiously, tenderly, her big dark
eyes questioning Kit. &ldquo;What about Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all worried about Mother, Jeannie. You&rsquo;re
not the only one,&rdquo; Kit snapped. &ldquo;But you can be aching
with love inside, and still not go moping around
with a long face like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; demanded Jean haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit it, kids, don&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; Tommy said, just as if
he were the eldest instead of the youngest. &ldquo;Gosh, you
two argue much more than Doris and I do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think,&rdquo; said Doris firmly, &ldquo;that we ought to
remember Mom just as Jean says. She&rsquo;s almost sick
herself worrying over Dad, and there she is, away
down in Philadelphia with nobody to share her
troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean smiled rather forlornly. She had assumed most
of the responsibility since they had been left alone.
Rebecca, their cousin, had arrived only a few days before
Mrs. Craig had left, and it had not been easy to
assume a mother&rsquo;s place suddenly and run the home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything seems to be coming at once,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;The party and Kit&rsquo;s minor masterpiece for Lincoln&rsquo;s
Birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Class symposium on &lsquo;Lincoln: The Man&mdash;The
President&mdash;The Liberator&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; Kit ran it off proudly.
&ldquo;Little classics of three hundred words each. You
should see Billie Warren&rsquo;s, Jean. He&rsquo;s been boiling
it down for a week from two thousand words, and
every day Barbie King asks him how he&rsquo;s getting
along. And you know how Billie talks. This morning
he just glowered and told her, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s still just sap!&rsquo;
What a character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kit, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Jean in spite of herself. &ldquo;If
you get ink spots on Mother&rsquo;s desk, you&rsquo;ll have a nice
mess on your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Kit moved the inkwell farther back as a small concession,
and suggested once more that the rest of the
family try to keep conversation down to a roar about
their old party while she finished her symposium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Doris began with a far-off look in
her eyes, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re awfully selfish, and I mean
all of us, not just Kit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. I love company,&rdquo; murmured Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Dad coming back home after five weeks&rsquo;
absence, and we don&rsquo;t know really whether he&rsquo;s better
or worse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris, don&rsquo;t even let yourself think that he&rsquo;s anything
but better,&rdquo; pleaded Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s perfectly true. He needs rest above everything
else, so the doctor told Mother. And here we are
planning a party for the day he gets home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad always insists that we go ahead and not upset
our plans. He says he feels better knowing we&rsquo;re
happy,&rdquo; replied Jean.</p>
<p>Kit stared out of the window again, thinking. At
fifteen she was far more energetic than Jean at seventeen.
Her agile mind easily found its way in and out of
difficulty. With her curly hair cut short, she seemed
more like another boy in the family. She, more than
the others, even Tommy, resembled their father in
many ways, lighthearted, gay, carefree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Secretly, Kit felt far more able to take the lead than
did Jean, now that the family was facing a crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ve called all the kids and Mother knows
we&rsquo;re going to have the party because I wrote her all
about it. She wrote back that she didn&rsquo;t mind a bit if
Becky didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you ask Becky, Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask her. She&rsquo;d say yes to anything you asked,
Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris thawed at once.</p>
<p>It seemed as if their elderly cousin had come down
from her calm and well-ordered seclusion at Elmhurst,
Connecticut, just when they needed her most.
Usually she contented herself with sending the family
useful and proper gifts on birthdays and at Christmas,
but they seldom saw her.</p>
<p>She was forty-seven, plump, serene, and still good-looking,
with her blonde hair just beginning to look
a trifle silvery, and a fine network of wrinkles showing
around the corners of her eyes and mouth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Land alive, Margaret Ann,&rdquo; she had told Mrs.
Craig happily the moment she set foot inside the wide
entrance hall at Sandy Cove, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I know you
needed me?&rdquo; And she laughed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t plan to descend
on you so sudden, but it looked as if you needed
someone, Tom down sick and you worn out taking
care of him. Don&rsquo;t you worry at all about my being put
out. I&rsquo;ll stay here with the children and take care of
things till you get back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mrs. Craig had agreed thankfully. After a
three months&rsquo; siege with her husband through his
nervous breakdown, she was glad indeed to welcome
the strong assistance of Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put it up to her right now,&rdquo; Kit exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon ask her if Doris is afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the others could hold her back, she had
slipped out of the living room and was racing up the
stairs, two at a time, into the large sunny room at the
south end of the house where one could look out over
Long Island Sound. But at the door Kit stopped short.
Over at the window stood Becky, energetically wiping
her eyes with a generous-sized plain linen handkerchief,
and the end of her nose was red from weeping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, my dear, come right in,&rdquo; she said hastily,
as Kit backed away. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you happened up.
Come here to your old second cousin and comfort her.
I feel as if all the waves in the Sound had washed over
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit hurried over, put her hand on Becky&rsquo;s arm, and
squeezed it reassuringly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Anything
about Dad?&rdquo; demanded Kit, swift to catch the
connection between her cousin&rsquo;s tears and words.
&ldquo;Did you get a letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Rebecca, &ldquo;your mother just telephoned
me from Philadelphia. Your father is worse
and the doctors think he would be better off at home.
They will be home in three days. You know, Kit,
they&rsquo;d never do that if the doctors could do anything
more.&rdquo; There was a break in Rebecca&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I just
wish I had him up home safe in the room he used to
have when he was a boy. He had measles the same time
I did when my mother was alive. That&rsquo;s your Aunt
Charlotte, Kit, she that was Charlotte Peabody from
Boston. But I always seemed to take after the Craig
side instead of the Peabody, they said, and Tom was
just like my own brother. I wish I had him away from
doctors and trained nurses and Army hospitals, and
had old Doctor Gallup tending him instead. I&rsquo;ve seen
him march right up to Charon&rsquo;s ferryboat and haul
out somebody he didn&rsquo;t think was through living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Kit stood with her hands clasped behind her head,
looking down at the pines, their branches lightly
crystalled with snow and ice. Somehow it didn&rsquo;t seem
as if God could let her father slip out of the world
after He had allowed him to come home from the war.
And just when they all needed him so much. During
all the months of illness, the girls and Tommy had not
grasped the seriousness of it. He only seemed weak
and not himself. They knew he had not gone back to
work in his office in New York after he left the Army,
but they had taken these things lightly.</p>
<p>Perhaps only Jean had really gleaned the meaning
of her mother&rsquo;s anxious face, the steady daily visits of
the nerve specialist, and, last of all, the decision to return
to the Army Hospital in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Kit closed her eyes and wrinkled her face as if with
a twinge of sharp pain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be awful,&rdquo; she
said softly, &ldquo;just awful for Mom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca squared her ample shoulders unconsciously,
and lifted her double chin in challenge to
the worry that the next few days might hold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse for you children and Tom. We women
are given special strength to bear just such trials.
We&rsquo;ve got to be strong,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But the tears came slowly, miserably to Kit&rsquo;s brown
eyes. She pulled the curtains back, and looked out as
the blue waters of the Sound were turning purple and
violet in the gathering gloom of the late afternoon.
The land looked desolate, and yet it was but a light
snowfall. Down close to the water some gulls rose and
swept in a big half circle toward the other side of the
inlet. Bob Phelps, running along the sidewalk toward
home, waved a big bunch of pussy willows at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spring&rsquo;s coming, Kit,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Just found some
and they&rsquo;re &rsquo;most out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit waved back mechanically. Of course she must
not break down and cry. Even Tommy wouldn&rsquo;t, and
she and Jean must be strong and brace up the two
younger ones so they all could help their mother. Still
the tears came. What was the use of spring if&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kit, aren&rsquo;t you ever coming down?&rdquo; called Jean
from the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; Kit answered. &ldquo;You come too, please,
Becky. We need you awfully. To tell us what to do
next.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rebecca calmly. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
need me anymore than the earth needs me to tell it
this snow&rsquo;s going away and the flowers will soon be
blossoming. The first thing you must do is learn how
to meet your father with a smile.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">2. Troubled Days Ahead</span></h2>
<p>The next three days were anxious ones. All plans for
the party had been cancelled, and after school the girls
and Tommy hung around Rebecca feeling that she
alone could help them bear the suspense. Jean occasionally
stole away to her mother&rsquo;s room and looked
around to be sure that everything was as she liked it
best, and when she came out into the wide upper hall
she usually met Kit and Doris stealing from their
father&rsquo;s room, their eyes red from crying.</p>
<p>Tommy hid himself in dark corners, rather like a
small puppy trying to run away from his fears. Kit declared
there wasn&rsquo;t a dry pillow in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about your own self?&rdquo; Doris asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cry too, but not all the time. I said before that I
don&rsquo;t intend to mope around. We&rsquo;ve got to keep a stiff
upper lip if we don&rsquo;t want to go to pieces. We must
represent the beyondness in feminine efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean, Kit?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>Kit gave Tommy a good-natured shove. &ldquo;Means
that we&rsquo;ve got to keep calm no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean said little. Ever since she could remember, her
mother had said to her, &ldquo;You know I rely on you most,
dear. You give me reassurance when I need it most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a thought that always gave her fresh strength,
to know how much her mother needed her. She was
smaller than Kit, slender and with dark eyes, with a
soft look about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeannie, you&rsquo;ve got such sympathetic, interested,
mellow eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eyes can&rsquo;t be mellow, Dorrie, try something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they are mellow just the same&mdash;tender and
nice, aren&rsquo;t they, Tommy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>And Tommy would always agree that they were.
But they were full of trouble now, as Jean hurried
around the house, following Rebecca&rsquo;s direction. Rebecca
really did herself proud as chief of operations.
Mr. Craig&rsquo;s rooms were immaculate and as clear of
nonessentials as the deck of a battleship. Under her
orders the girls worked hard, Tommy ran all the errands
she demanded, while Lydia, the Hungarian
maid who came in by the day, regarded her with silent,
wide-eyed admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d never have managed without you, Rebecca,&rdquo;
Jean declared when the final day arrived, and they all
gathered in the long living room, listening for the
hum of the car up the drive. Doris and Tommy were
curled up on the wide window seat. Kit paced back
and forth restlessly, and Jean sat with her legs dangling
over the arm of her father&rsquo;s lounge chair before
the open fireplace. She was watching the curling
flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, child, I don&rsquo;t see what you want to burn
open fires for when you run a good furnace,&rdquo; Rebecca
had demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t necessary,&rdquo; Jean answered, getting
up from the chair to poke at the fire already blazing
steadily, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s consoling to watch an open fire.
Don&rsquo;t you think so, Becky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca sat in the old-fashioned pine rocker, placidly
knitting on a sweater she was making for Tommy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must all hope for the best,&rdquo; she said, beaming
at the anxious faces. &ldquo;Doris, for pity&rsquo;s sake stop that
silent drizzling. If your father were to walk in now,
he&rsquo;d certainly be discouraged to look at you. I feel just
as badly as any of you.&rdquo; She took off her glasses, that
were always balanced halfway down her nose, and
reminisced, &ldquo;Land, didn&rsquo;t I live with him for years
after his mother died? That was your own grandmother,
Doris Craig. I&rsquo;ve still got her spinning
wheel up home in the attic. But I always did say we
made too much woe of the passing over of our dear
ones. And for heaven&rsquo;s sake, your father not gone
yet. Smile, even if your hearts do ache, and cheer
him up. Don&rsquo;t meet him with tears and fears. Jean,
run and tell Lydia to keep an eye on that beef tea
while I&rsquo;m here. It has to keep simmering. Kit, can&rsquo;t
you keep still for a minute, or does it ease your mind
to keep pacing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she encouraged and cheered them, and when
the car came up the driveway to the porch steps
with Mr. and Mrs. Craig, the four children did their
best to look happy. Mr. Craig, wrapped well in the
automobile robe, waved to them, his lean, handsome
face showing an eagerness to be with them
once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, my dears,&rdquo; he called to them. &ldquo;Becky,
God bless you, give me a hand. I&rsquo;m still rather
shaky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all trying to kiss him at once, and
Tommy held one of his thin white hands in his
strong ones. It did not require the look in their
mother&rsquo;s eyes to warn them about being careful.
Slender and tall, she stood behind him smiling at
them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he doesn&rsquo;t look nearly so bad as I expected,&rdquo;
Rebecca told her, kissing her in a motherly
way. Somehow it seemed quite natural for all to
pet and comfort Mom. It had been the same when
their father had been in the service; now, more than
ever, when the past three months had shown them
the possibilities of trouble and sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t tire him, girls,&rdquo; she told them.
&ldquo;Tommy, help your father upstairs.&rdquo; He and Becky
between them helped Mr. Craig go up, one step at a
time, then a rest before the next. &ldquo;He must have a
chance to recover from the trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land,&rdquo; Rebecca called back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so relieved
that you didn&rsquo;t have to bring him back on a
stretcher I can hardly catch my breath.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hopeful since he stood the trip so well,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Craig. She leaned her head against the
back of the big, cushioned chair. Jean slipped off her
coat and Doris took her gloves. Tommy came downstairs
and put a fresh log on the fire and Kit hurried
out to the kitchen after a cup of tea. They all hovered
over her, each eager to make her comfortable. Then
suddenly, unable to hold back any longer, she burst
into tears. Jean rushed to her side and pulled her close
into her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother darling,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t cry so.
Why, you&rsquo;re home, and we&rsquo;re all going to look after
him, and help you as much as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris raced out of the room and up the stairs after
Rebecca, and presently she came bustling downstairs,
flushed and efficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Margaret Ann,&rdquo; she cried, smoothing back
her hair just as if she had been one of the children.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give way just when your strength is needed
most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please call me Margie,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Craig,
smiling a little. &ldquo;It sounds so formal for you to call
me Margaret Ann. It always makes me feel like squaring
my shoulders, Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you should, child,&rdquo; Rebecca declared cheerily.
&ldquo;Margie&rsquo;s so sort of gay to my way of thinking and
there&rsquo;s stability to Margaret Ann. Lord knows, you&rsquo;re
going to need a lot of stability before you find the way
out of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am.&rdquo; As she spoke she held her family
close to her, Doris and Tommy kneeling beside her
and Jean and Kit on each side. She leaned back and
smiled at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Becky said. &ldquo;Now you children let
her go up to her room. I have to tend my broth and see
how Tom&rsquo;s coming along. Looks to me like rest and
quiet will carry him through if anything will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Becky!&rdquo; There was a note of panic in their Mother&rsquo;s
voice. Nobody but the same unemotional Becky
knew how she longed to put her head right down on
that ample bosom and have a good old-fashioned cry.
&ldquo;Becky, the doctors at the hospital say he&rsquo;ll never be
any better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Becky indignantly,
with a toss of her head. &ldquo;Lots they know about
it. I never take any stock in those doctors at all, Margie.
Give me castor oil, some quinine and calomel,
and maybe a little arnica salve for emergencies, and
I&rsquo;ll undertake to help anybody hang on to themselves
a little bit longer. They can keep their penicillin and
sulfa powder and other fancy drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;But things seem so near a crisis now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them.&rdquo; Rebecca stood with her hands on her
hips, as if she were hurling defiance at somebody, and
the family fairly hung on her words. &ldquo;Buck up, Margie
Craig. As for you, Jean and Kit and Doris and
Tommy, if I find any of you looking doleful, I declare
I&rsquo;ll stick clothespins on your noses and fasten a smile
to your lips with adhesive tape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even without this advice the children were determined
to look cheerful and to keep their father carefree
and happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">3. Becky Steps In</span></h2>
<p>Saturday came and went without the party. Once,
and sometimes twice a day the doctor&rsquo;s car turned into
the broad pebbled driveway and the children went
around with subdued voices and anxious faces. Even
Lydia, down in her kitchen domain, looked foreboding,
and told Rebecca that she had dreamed three
times of three blackbirds perching on the chimneys,
which was a sure sign of death, anyone could tell you,
in her own country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is, and maybe it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Becky laughed
back. &ldquo;If I were you, Lydia, I&rsquo;d take something for
my liver and go to bed a little earlier at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>All the same, her own face looked worried when
she entered the sick room and looked down at Mr.
Craig&rsquo;s face on the pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems ridiculous for me to be lying here,
Becky,&rdquo; he would say to her, with the whimsical
boyish smile she loved. &ldquo;Why, there isn&rsquo;t anything the
matter with me only I&rsquo;m tired out. Machinery&rsquo;s out of
whack is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing special only that you can&rsquo;t eat or
walk or sit up without keeling over.&rdquo; Her keen hazel
eyes were amused as she looked at him. &ldquo;You know,
Tom Craig, if it wasn&rsquo;t for Margie, the girls, and
Tommy, I&rsquo;d take you straight home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked from her to the window. Jean had just
brought in a bunch of daffodils in a slender glass vase
and had set them in the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going soon, are you, Becky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca seated herself in the chair beside his bed.
As she would have put it, there was a time for all
things, and this seemed an opportune one for her to
get something off her mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to pretty soon. It looks like an early
spring, Tom, and there&rsquo;s a heap of work waiting for
me up there. Of course Matt knows how things go as
well as I do, but I&rsquo;ve been away over a month now, and
I like to have the oversight of things. Men are only
boys, after all, and you can&rsquo;t expect too much from
them. I want to get the barn shingled, and some more
hen runs set out before the chicks begin to hatch, and
all my berry patches need clearing out. You know that
mass of blackberries along the stone wall in the clover
patch below the lane&mdash;what&rsquo;s the matter, Tom?&rdquo; She
glanced at him in alarm.</p>
<p>He had closed his eyes as if in pain, and his hand
closed suddenly over her own as it lay on the blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes me homesick to hear you talk, Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their glances met in a long look of sympathetic remembrance
of the old days at Maple Grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were not for the children,&rdquo; he went on slowly.
&ldquo;They are all at an age now when they need the advantages
of being near the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; answered Becky dubiously.
&ldquo;I suppose you feel that you can do more for
them down here, Tom, and it is a beautiful place to
live, but you did pretty well yourself up at the old
Green District, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what Margie would say to the Green District
schoolhouse?&rdquo; he asked. A vision of it arose
out of the memories of the past, the little red schoolhouse
that stood at the crossroads, with rocky pastures
rising high behind it, and the long white dusty road
curving before it. He had been just a country boy,
born and bred within a few miles of Maple Grove at
the old Craig homestead. He knew every cow path
through the woods around Elmhurst, every big chestnut
and hickory tree for five miles around, every fork
and bend in the course of the wild little river that cut
through the valley meadows. Somehow, in these days
of weakness and fear that he was losing his grip on life,
there had grown a great yearning to be home again, to
find himself back in the shelter of the protecting hills.
They had always been the hills of rest to him as a boy.
He had often turned his thoughts to them longingly
while he sloshed through jungles in the Pacific, but
now they beckoned to him even more urgently to
come back to peace and health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t country-bred, is she, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>The question called him to reality from his dreams.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered gently, &ldquo;no, Margie&rsquo;s from California.
I believe her people went out originally from
New York State, but she herself was born in San
Diego. Later, she lived on her father&rsquo;s ranch for a
while in the Coronado Valley, but she was educated
in the city. She doesn&rsquo;t know anything about farm life
as we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca looked nonplussed. California might just
as well be Borneo, so far as her knowledge of it was
concerned. It did seem rather too bad that Margie had
come from such far-off stock, but still, she thought, a
great deal could be excused in her on account of it,
since it wasn&rsquo;t given to everybody to be born in New
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she mind it just for a summer, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have to be for a longer time than one
summer, Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his voice made her suspicious. Mrs.
Craig had walked out to meet the girls on their way
home from the movies. A lone adventurous fly crept
up the window curtain and Rebecca promptly
slapped him with a ready hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pesky thing, doesn&rsquo;t it know it&rsquo;s not time for them
to start pestering us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What did you say,
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I said that it would have to be for a longer time
than just one summer. Things have not gone well
with me for the past year. I haven&rsquo;t got the guts to
break the news to Margie now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have,&rdquo; said Becky promptly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
fair to her not to share your sorrows with her as well
as your joys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margie had enough to worry about in the years I
was away when she was managing alone to keep the
family together. I don&rsquo;t want to have her worrying
about money now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like a man. So now you&rsquo;ve backed yourself up
against a stone wall and can&rsquo;t see a way out. Can I
help you? How much money do you need to tide you
over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Becky. You&rsquo;d give anyone your left ear
if they needed it, wouldn&rsquo;t you? You don&rsquo;t understand
how we live. It takes nearly every cent I get from the
government to cover our current expenses. We&rsquo;ve already
made a large hole in our savings in order to get
medicine and things. I&rsquo;m wondering what we are going
to do, and I dread even mentioning it to Margie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me do it,&rdquo; said Miss Craig promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
love to. Better yet, talk it over with the whole family if
you&rsquo;re strong enough. How long can you hold out
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain.&rdquo; He looked weary and harassed.
&ldquo;We only rent the place and the lease is up the first of
May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you can rent a good farm up home for
what you pay here, Tom&mdash;house, barns, pasture, hay
fields, wood lots and all,&rdquo; said Rebecca thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice place here, but the cost of living is so high.&rdquo;
She looked out at the clean park-like territory around
the large modern house. Winding drives swept in and
out. Each residence stood in its own spacious grounds.
There was an artificial pond where the children
skated in winter, and the country club crowned the
hill with a golf course sloping away to the shore on the
north.</p>
<p>Down in the ravine stood the gray stone railroad
station matching the real estate office over the way,
and farther along were the village stores, the new
high school of brick and concrete, and the two
churches. Back and forth along the smooth highway
slipped a never-ending line of cars and trucks coming
and going like ants over an ant hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Becky turned her head toward the bed once more
and asked, &ldquo;Would you rather stay here than go up
home with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;d rather do. It&rsquo;s what we may have
to do unless I gain my old strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get a bit better lying there worrying
over unpaid bills and new ones stacking up. I&rsquo;m going
to talk to Margie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head with a little smile of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it would never be fair to take them away from
this sort of thing, Becky. You don&rsquo;t understand. Their
friends are all here. And Jean has been taking up a
course in applied design and ceramics, and Doris has
her music. Kit&rsquo;s deep in schoolwork and belongs to
about five clubs outside of that. Even Tommy has a
swimming class keeping him busy after school two
days a week. Margie&rsquo;s on more committees and things
than I can count, and she believes we owe it to the children
to give them the best social environment that we
can. Perhaps we can get along in some way. There&rsquo;s a
little left at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; demanded Rebecca uncompromisingly.
&ldquo;I mean, after you&rsquo;ve paid up everything. I&rsquo;ll
bet there isn&rsquo;t five thousand left.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand! I doubt much whether there is one
thousand. Don&rsquo;t tell Margie that. I still have a few
securities I might sell and realize something on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think that you&rsquo;ve been a good husband
to her. Land alive, what are men made of! Here she
stands a chance of being left alone in the world with
four children to bring up and you&rsquo;ve never bothered
her about your business. The sooner you get to it the
better, I think.&rdquo; Rebecca stood up and adjusted her
glasses resolutely. She had seen what he could not,
Margie coming leisurely up the walk, a loose cluster
of pussy willows in her arms, and the girls following,
all except Kit. &ldquo;There they come now. I won&rsquo;t say anything
till you do, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Kit&rsquo;s voice sounded at the door. Her short
curls were rumpled and unbrushed, her eyes wide
with excitement, as she hugged a heating pad to her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard almost every word you said,&rdquo; she burst
out. &ldquo;I had an earache and stayed home this afternoon,
and I&rsquo;ve been asleep in there on the couch. Please
don&rsquo;t worry, Dad. I think it would be glorious for us
all to go up into the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>She stopped as the front door banged and Tommy
came crashing upstairs completely out of breath from
a strenuous game of baseball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, child, keep your mouth shut till we know
where we&rsquo;re at,&rdquo; warned Becky quickly. &ldquo;Go back and
lie down. Here they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kit stood her ground, and Jean and Doris
seemed to catch from her the fact that something was
up as they came in behind their mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a lovely walk,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craig, removing
her gloves as she sat down beside the bed and smiled
at the patient. &ldquo;We went past the Dunderdale place,
Tom. It is simply lovely there. I never saw so many
shrubs and trees and such beautiful landscaping. It
made me think of the homes out in California. You&rsquo;d
enjoy the garden so this summer, and there is a
screened-in porch across the back of the house. The
garage is small, but it will do if we don&rsquo;t get a new car
this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right here Rebecca sniffed, a real, unmistakable
sniff. She was a believer in quick action. If you had
anything to do, the quicker you did it and got over it
the better, she always said. So now she raised her head
as they looked at her, and set them all back on their
heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get a new car this year, Margie, my
dear, and you&rsquo;re not going to move to any expensive
house, either. I&rsquo;m going to take the whole lot of you
to Elmhurst, and see if Tom can&rsquo;t get his health back
up in that peaceful countryside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">4. Pulling Together</span></h2>
<p>A queer silence hung over all of them in the room.
Mrs. Craig looked down at the tired face lying back
on the white pillows with a startled expression in her
usually calm eyes. Instinctively both her hands
reached for his and held them fast, while Jean laid her
own two down on her mother&rsquo;s shoulders as if she
would have given her strength for this new problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean for a little visit, don&rsquo;t you, Becky?&rdquo; she
asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, Jeannie. I mean for good and all, or at
least until your father has time to get well, and that
can&rsquo;t be done in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Doctor Martin says he&rsquo;s gaining every day,&rdquo;
Mrs. Craig said. She waited for some reassuring answer,
her eyes almost begging for one, but Rebecca
held her ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, tell what the doctor said to us this morning.
Not that I take much stock in him, but he may be on
the right track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing special,&rdquo; said Mr. Craig as he smiled back
at them, &ldquo;only it appears that I am to be laid up in dry
dock for repairs for a long time, and the sinews of war
won&rsquo;t stand the vacation expenses if we stay where we
are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t try to talk about it, dear, before the
children,&rdquo; began Mrs. Craig, quick to avoid anything
that sounded like trouble or anxiety. &ldquo;We must not
worry. There will be some way out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Becky went on serenely. &ldquo;I say you&rsquo;d
better move right out of this kind of a place where expenses
are high and you can&rsquo;t afford anything at all.
This is a real crisis, Margaret Ann.&rdquo; She spoke with
more decision as she saw Jean pat her mother comfortingly.
&ldquo;It has got to be met with common sense.
When the breadwinner can&rsquo;t work and there&rsquo;s a
houseful of youngsters to bring up and feed and
clothe, it&rsquo;s time to sit up and take notice, and count
all of your resources.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;How would it do for you to take Dad up home
with you for a rest, Becky?&rdquo; Jean suggested, stepping
into the awkward breach as she always did. &ldquo;Then we
could let Lydia go and manage alone. And when he
came back we&rsquo;d have all the moving over, and it would
be the prettiest time of the year along in late August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s face brightened at the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we might even renew the lease here, Tom. The
house is very pleasant after all, and we could get along
with it if it were all done over this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Craig looked up at Rebecca&rsquo;s face helplessly,
and she answered the appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; she said with decision and finality.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get the idea of staying here right
out of your head, Margie. Circumstances have made it
entirely out of the question. If you&rsquo;re the kind of
woman I think you are, you&rsquo;ll start making plans to
move where it&rsquo;s less expensive. I think your way lies
over the hills to Elmhurst. You can pay all your bills
here, sell off a lot of heavy furniture, and move up
there this spring. For you can&rsquo;t stay here. There&rsquo;s
hardly enough money to see you through as it is. I&rsquo;m
going to help you along a bit until you get your new
start.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not money enough!&rdquo; said Mrs. Craig as though
she could not believe it. &ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t think of
going up there and all living with you, Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to,&rdquo; answered Rebecca. &ldquo;Thank
the Lord, I live in a land where houses and food are
comparatively cheap and there&rsquo;s room for everybody.
We don&rsquo;t tack a brass doorplate on a rock pile like I
saw there in New York, Margie, and call it a home at
about ten dollars a minute to breathe. I&rsquo;ve been telling
Tom you&rsquo;d better rent a farm near me, and settle
down on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Becky&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Craig hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mom, do it, do it,&rdquo; came in a quick outburst
from Kit, standing back against the wall. &ldquo;It would be
swell for all of us and would do wonders for Dad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t mind a bit. We&rsquo;d love it, wouldn&rsquo;t
we, Tommy?&rdquo; Doris squeezed Tommy&rsquo;s hand to be
sure he would answer in the affirmative. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d all
help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy was silent, still too bewildered at the idea
to express an opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind for myself, but we must think of
the children&mdash;their schooling and what environment
means to teen-agers. I suppose Jean could be left at
school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought she was all through school,&rdquo; interrupted
Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, only I&rsquo;ve been taking lessons in town this
winter in a special course, arts and crafts, you know,
and next fall I was going into the regular classes at the
National Academy of Design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for, dear?&rdquo; Becky&rsquo;s gray eyes twinkled behind
her glasses. &ldquo;Going to be an artist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly pictures,&rdquo; Jean answered with dignity.
&ldquo;Textile design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it is, I guess it will hold over for a
year while you go up to the country and learn to keep
house. Kit here can go to high school. It&rsquo;s seven miles
away, but there&rsquo;s a school bus that picks up those who
live too far away to walk. It&rsquo;s real handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit&rsquo;s eyes signaled to Jean, and Jean&rsquo;s to Doris and
Tommy. A fleeting vision of that &ldquo;handy&rdquo; trip to high
school in the dead of winter appeared before them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it, dear?&rdquo; asked Mr. Craig,
looking longingly up at the face of his wife. &ldquo;It would
be a great comfort and relief to me to get back to those
old hills, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem fair to you or the children.
The sacrifice is too great. They do need the right
kind of environment, as you say. Suppose we left Jean
where she could keep up her studies, and perhaps put
Kit into a private school. Then I might go up home
with Becky, and you and the two younger ones could
go out to California to Benita Ranch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Craig laid her fingers on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to banish us to Benita Ranch. If
you think it is the best thing to do, Tom, we&rsquo;ll all go
with you. Wherever you go, I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris laid her hand over Jean&rsquo;s, and they stepped
out softly. Their mother, they saw, needed to be alone
with their father. They fled downstairs to the study
back of the living room and were followed by Kit and
Tommy who were already deep in an argument about
the entire situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to move up there,&rdquo; Doris
said, judicially. &ldquo;We may not like it at all, and there
we&rsquo;d be just the same, stuck in a rut, and maybe we
never could get out of it, and we&rsquo;d grow old and look
just like Becky and talk like her and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, kid, be careful of what you say,&rdquo; Kit
said sharply. &ldquo;Becky is odd in some ways but she influences
a lot of people in her home town. And here
too. I wish I had half her common sense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate common sense,&rdquo; Jean cried passionately. &ldquo;I
suppose it&rsquo;s the only thing to do but did you see Mom&rsquo;s
face? It was utterly tragic. Dad&rsquo;s been a country boy,
and he&rsquo;s going back home where he knows all about
everything and loves it, but Mother&rsquo;s so different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mom&rsquo;s a darling, but she&rsquo;s adaptable too,
and she&rsquo;ll go, you see if she doesn&rsquo;t. And it won&rsquo;t kill
any of us. The really great mind should rise superior
to its environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tell Kit that the first time she gripes about
dishwashing,&rdquo; Doris said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything
about Lydia going along, did you, Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do your share all right, Kathleen, and when
the gray dawn is breaking at that,&rdquo; laughed Jean.
&ldquo;Farm life&rsquo;s no snap and really, while I wouldn&rsquo;t disagree
with Dad and Becky about it, I think that those
who have special gifts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning me&mdash;should not waste their time doing
what is not their forte. It takes away the work from
those who can&rsquo;t do the other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean&rsquo;s eyes twinkled and she smiled slightly, but Kit
took her seriously and shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to walk the straight and narrow path
up at Elmhurst under Becky&rsquo;s eagle eye just the same,
Jean. It&rsquo;s no use kicking. I don&rsquo;t mind so much leaving
this place, but we&rsquo;ll miss the kids like crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the roller skating,&rdquo; added Doris, who went to
the neighborhood skating rink with a gang of boys
and girls every Friday night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss that.
I wonder if there is a roller rink up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see where Kit steps off the basketball team and
learns how to run a lawn mower,&rdquo; Kit remarked.
&ldquo;Also there will be no Wednesday evening dancing
class, Doris, where you can polish your jitterbug
steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could all move back to town and see if
we couldn&rsquo;t do something to earn money,&rdquo; Jean said.
&ldquo;One of the girls in the art class found a job designing
wallpaper the other day, and another one is making
ceramics. When the fortunes of the Victorian family
suddenly crashed, the humble but still genteel family
usually took in paying guests, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it went out of style ages ago, Jeannie,&rdquo; Kit
kicked off her shoes and stared at her blue angora
socks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not take in any boarders at all. I see myself
waiting on table this summer at some hillside farm
retreat for aged and respectable females. If we&rsquo;ve got
to work, let&rsquo;s pitch in and help at home first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;And if it has to be, let&rsquo;s not fuss and make things
harder for Mom,&rdquo; Doris put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about Dad?&rdquo; Kit demanded. &ldquo;Seems to me
that he&rsquo;s got the hardest part to bear. It&rsquo;s bad enough
lying there sick all the time, without feeling that
you&rsquo;re dragging the whole family after you and exiling
them to Elmhurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a riot, kids,&rdquo; Jean said all at once, her eyes
softening and her dimples showing again. &ldquo;Just the
minute any one of us takes Dad&rsquo;s part, someone
springs up and gives a yell for Mother, and vice versa.
We won&rsquo;t be lonesome up there so long as we have
ourselves&mdash;you know we won&rsquo;t&mdash;and if things are slow,
then we&rsquo;ll start something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we? Oh, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Kit cried. She got up,
walked across the study, and put a stack of records on
the phonograph. In a few seconds <i>Begin the Beguine</i>
blared out and Kit did a few dance steps back to her
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Jean said with a sigh of relief.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to pull all together, and make the best of
things. Dad&rsquo;s sick, and Mother&rsquo;s worried to death.
Let&rsquo;s promise ourselves to be as much help as possible
and otherwise not get in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">5. Busy Days Ahead</span></h2>
<p>Becky departed for Elmhurst, Connecticut, the following
Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you with me, Tom, if it were spring,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but the first of March we get some pretty bad
spells of weather, and it&rsquo;s uncertain for anybody in
poor health. You stay here and cheer up and get
stronger, and gradually break camp. If you need any
help, let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was harder breaking camp than any of them
realized. They had lived six years at Sandy Cove, near
Great Neck on Long Island. Before that time, there
had been an apartment in New York on Columbia
Heights. As Kit described it with her usual graphic
touch, &ldquo;Bird&rsquo;s-eye Castle, eight stories up. Fine view
of adjacent clouds. With field glasses on clear days, you
could also see the tops of the Riverside busses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>It had seemed almost like real country to the girls
and Tommy when they had left the city behind them
and moved to Sandy Cove. Tommy had the measles
that year, and the doctor had ordered fresh air and an
outdoor life for him, so the whole family had benefited,
which was very thoughtful and considerate of
Tommy, the rest said.</p>
<p>But now came the problem of weeding out what Rebecca
would have called the essential things from the
luxuries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, I had no idea we had so many of the
pomps and vanities of this wicked world,&rdquo; Jean said
regretfully one day. There were eight rooms in the big
home, all well-furnished. Living room, dining room
and study, with Lydia&rsquo;s domain at the back. Upstairs
were four bedrooms. Sitting on the bed and the floor
of Jean&rsquo;s room, the three girls and Tommy were sorting
out their belongings and piling up nonessentials
to be thrown away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find anything more of mine that I&rsquo;m willing
to part with,&rdquo; said Tommy flatly, stuffing a catcher&rsquo;s
mitt into a box already jammed full. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need that to
practice with. What&rsquo;s a luxury anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes me think of Bob Phelps,&rdquo; Doris remarked.
&ldquo;Last night when I went over to tell Mrs. Phelps that
we couldn&rsquo;t be in the Easter play, Bob was just having
his supper, and he wanted more of the prune whip.
His mother told him he mustn&rsquo;t gorge on delicacies.
So Bob asked what a delicacy was anyway, and he said
some day he was going to have a whole meal made of
delicacies. Isn&rsquo;t that a scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t throw away any pieces at all, kids,&rdquo; Jean
warned. &ldquo;Becky says we&rsquo;ll need them all for rag carpets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can buy rag rugs and carpets anywhere now,&rdquo;
said Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and oh, brother, at what prices too. We people
who are going to live at Elmhurst will cut and sew our
own, roll them in nice fat balls, and hand them over
to Mr. Carpenter up at Denton, to be woven into the
real thing at fifteen cents a yard. It&rsquo;ll last for years,
Becky says. When you get tired of it, you boil it up in
some dye, and have a new effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit regarded her elder sister in speechless delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jean Craig, you&rsquo;re catching it!&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking exactly like Becky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I am. I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; answered Jean
blithely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s common sense. Save the pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She who used to be most concerned about what she
was going to wear to the next formal has suddenly
changed her tune,&rdquo; murmured Kit. &ldquo;I marvel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked down at the garden, windswept and bare
in the last chilly days of February. Yet there was a hint
of spring in the air. An early robin was perched near
the grape arbor they had all enjoyed so much, with its
luscious grapes and ceiling of green leaves. Leading
from it to the hedged garden at the back was a flagged
walk.</p>
<p>The garage was of reddish fieldstone and, like the
house, covered with ivy. A tall privet hedge enclosed
the grounds. Memories of all the fun which they had
enjoyed in the past six years passed through her mind.
There had been picnics and dances, beach parties and
tennis games. She hugged her knees, rocking back and
forth anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s eating you, Kit?&rdquo; asked Jean, mildly. Jean
was the first to have an emotional storm over the inevitable,
but once it was over, she always settled down
to make the best of things, while Kit was gloomy and
raged inwardly for days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what we&rsquo;ll really find to do there all the
time. I don&rsquo;t want to be a merry milkmaid, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it would help Dad and Mother, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But definitely. You don&rsquo;t have a monopoly on the
desire to help, you know. We&rsquo;d all walk from here to
Elmhurst on our left ears if it would help Dad and
Mother, but the fact that we&rsquo;d do it wouldn&rsquo;t make it
any easier, would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a dope, Kit,&rdquo; said Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a dope?&rdquo; demanded Kit. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as
ready to face this thing as anyone. If it were a small
town up in the wilds, even, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind, but it
just isn&rsquo;t anything but country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean pulled off the ribbon that tied her hair back
and started pulling at a lock thoughtfully. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
Elmhurst then? Isn&rsquo;t that a town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a village. Nearest town seven miles
away, post office five. There used to be a post office
there when the mail truck made the trip over, but they
needed the building to keep the hearse in, so it&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making that up, Kit,&rdquo; put in Doris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; protested Kit. &ldquo;You can ask Becky. Nobody
ever dies up there. They just fade away, and the
hearse is seldom needed and was in the way. There are
only nine houses in the village proper, one store, one
church, and one school. Her house is a mile outside
the village, so where will we be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it on the map?&rdquo; asked Tommy hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some maps. Township maps. This morning
Mother and I were looking up how to get there.
You&rsquo;ve got your choice of two routes and each one&rsquo;s
worse than the other, and more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kit, you&rsquo;re exaggerating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit ignored the remark, absorbed in her own forebodings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can reach this spot by land or sea. Becky says
that it takes five hours for anybody to get out of there
once they&rsquo;re in. You can take a boat to New London,
ride up to Norwich on the train, transfer to a bus and
rattle along for another hour, then hire a cab in East
Elmhurst, and drive twenty minutes more up through
the hills. Or you can take a Boston Express up to Willimantic,
and hop on a side line from there. A train runs
twice a day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;What road, Kit?&rdquo; asked Doris. They leaned
around her, fascinated at her sudden store of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any road you please. Central Vermont up to
Plainfield, or Providence line over to South Elmhurst.
There&rsquo;s South Elmhurst and East Elmhurst and Elmhurst
Green and Elmhurst Station. It really doesn&rsquo;t
seem to matter which way you go so long as it lands
you at one of the Elmhursts. And Elmhurst Station is
five miles from Elmhurst, Plainfield is seven miles,
Boulderville is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, Kit, quit it,&rdquo; Jean cried, both hands
over her ears. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drive over anyway. Didn&rsquo;t you
know that Dad and I are going to take the car up first
before the rest of you? We&rsquo;re going to sell Mother&rsquo;s
car,&rdquo; said Jean. &ldquo;The Phelpses are going to buy it. Bob
told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad says it will pay nearly all moving expenses and
keep us for months. What else could he do? Besides,
we&rsquo;ll still have one car, that&rsquo;s enough. At least we
won&rsquo;t be completely marooned. He&rsquo;d sell that one too
only it&rsquo;s an absolute necessity to have one. We&rsquo;re going
to have to buy a trailer, too, for hauling things. Anyway
I want a horse to ride, don&rsquo;t you, Kit?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer,&rdquo; Doris broke in, &ldquo;when a father
breaks down, it just seems as if a home caves in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t do any such thing, Doris,&rdquo; responded
Kit stolidly. &ldquo;It may seem to, but it doesn&rsquo;t.
Even if we are going to live five miles from nowhere
with the eye of Rebecca forever resting upon us,
there&rsquo;ll be lots of fun ahead. What&rsquo;s that about the
world making a pathway to your door? I&rsquo;m going to be
famous some day and there&rsquo;ll be a nice, well-worn
path leading from New York up to Elmhurst, worn by
the feet of faithful admirers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so nice having one genius in the family,&rdquo; Jean
answered, leaning her chin on one hand. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t
mind leaving the house behind, or the car, or anything
like that. But it&rsquo;s the people I like best that I can&rsquo;t take
up with me. Who will we know there, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human beings anyhow,&rdquo; Doris stated. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
make oodles of new friends. Besides, lots of the girls
have promised to visit us. We&rsquo;re not going to be lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">6. Pulling Up Stakes</span></h2>
<p>It had been suggested that Kit and Jean stay behind
to finish their schooling. They could board at the
Phelpses&rsquo; home next to Sandy Cove along the shore
road, but both girls begged to go with the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay?&rdquo; advised Doris. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll escape
all of the moving and settling and ploughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to escape anything,&rdquo; said Kit
firmly. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any fun being left behind with the
charred remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kit, don&rsquo;t call them that, it&rsquo;s gruesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I feel gruesome when I think of being
left behind. How do you suppose we&rsquo;d feel to walk
past the Cove and not see any of the rest of you
around?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than being cut right bang off in the middle
of everything,&rdquo; replied Doris, with one of her rare
explosions. &ldquo;But everything,&rdquo; she repeated tragically.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t finish a single thing and I know I&rsquo;ll never pass,
being switched off to gosh knows what sort of a
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not grouch anyway,&rdquo; reminded Jean.
&ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s getting thinner every day. As long as it&rsquo;s got
to be, let&rsquo;s be cheerful about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish that Kit wouldn&rsquo;t be so happy about
things that make you just miserable,&rdquo; grumbled
Doris.</p>
<p>Kit danced away down the hallway crooning:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Night and day,</p>
<p class="t0">You are the one.</p>
<p class="t0">Only you beneath the moon</p>
<p class="t0">And under the sun.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old tease, Kit,&rdquo; Jean admonished in her
very best big-sister style. &ldquo;Please keep away from that
crate of dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>It had been decided to send Mr. Craig up before the
moving, so he could have a week or two of rest at
Maple Grove, Rebecca&rsquo;s home. The latter was diligently
sending down descriptions of adjacent farms
and all sorts of home possibilities, but none seemed to
fit the bill. Either there was too much land or not
enough, or it was too far from the village or not far
enough, or too much room or not room enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For gosh sake,&rdquo; Kit said one night, after all the
family had suggested various possible houses, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
all tent out and do summer light housekeeping. We&rsquo;ll
never find just what we want&mdash;never, Mom. Jean
wants a rose garden. I want at least a tennis court, even
if we have to remove the hay fields. Doris wants wisteria
arbors and a very large vine-covered porch.
Tommy wants a dog, four cats, a hive of bees, a calf,
and a pony. You want a house facing south, far back
from the road, barn not too near, dry cellar, porch,
century-old elms for shade, modern kitchen, indoor
plumbing, and option of purchase, not over sixty-five
dollars a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Dad?&rdquo; asked Jean. It was one
of her father&rsquo;s good days, when he was able to sit up
in his big lounge chair before the fire in the bedroom,
and be one of the family circle with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace and rest,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Craig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Kit agreed, kneeling beside his chair and
rubbing her head up and down his arm. &ldquo;Dad and I
are going to seek glorious peace the livelong day under
some shady chestnut tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad may, but you won&rsquo;t, Kathleen,&rdquo; Jean laughingly
warned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a family project and
you&rsquo;ll have to do your share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we were going to an island,&rdquo; Doris said wistfully.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt as if I could do wonders with an
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody could. There&rsquo;s some chance for imagination
to work on an island, but what can you do
with a farm in Elmhurst?&rdquo; Kit looked pensive with
her head on one side, eyes half closed in melancholy
anticipation. &ldquo;Darling, precious old Dad here
doesn&rsquo;t know a blessed thing about farming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Kit, go easy,&rdquo; Mr. Craig chided. &ldquo;After all,
I was born and raised on a farm. I should have
learned something about it, I expect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all be scouring pots, Kathleen,&rdquo; offered
Jean. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Craigs&rsquo; destiny. You know, Dad, I
thought all along that Lydia would go with us. I
thought she&rsquo;d feel hurt if we didn&rsquo;t take her, after
she&rsquo;d been telling us all these fairy tales about her
native land where she loved to milk twenty cows at
three A. M. I thought she&rsquo;d simply leap at the chance
of rural delights, and now she isn&rsquo;t going along with
us at all. She says she won&rsquo;t go anywhere unless there
are streetcars, tall buildings, and movies. It&rsquo;s going
to be tough without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s going to be nearly as bad
as we expect,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig said happily, as she passed
through the room with her favorite silver candlesticks
in her hands. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re facing the summer, remember,
and I can&rsquo;t help thinking that Rebecca will be a regular
bulwark of strength to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the second week in March word came from the
family&rsquo;s bulwark that she thought the weather was
mild enough for Jean and Mr. Craig to attempt the
trip. Accordingly, the first section of the caravan set
out on its trip to the land of oblivion, as Kit called it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem, Mom,&rdquo; Jean said at the last minute,
&ldquo;as if Kit ought to go with Dad, and let me stay down
here to help you close up things. Kit knows how to
drive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have you with your father.&rdquo; Mrs. Craig
laid her hands tenderly on Jean&rsquo;s slender shoulders.
&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t be with him, I&rsquo;d rather have the little first
mate. Remember how he used to call you that, when
you were only Tommy&rsquo;s size?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I feel terribly grown up now, Mother.
Seventeen is really the dividing line. You begin to
think of everything in a more serious way, you know.
When I look at Kit and Doris sometimes, it seems
years and years since I felt the way they do, so sort of
irresponsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old grandma.&rdquo; Mrs. Craig laughed as she
kissed her.</p>
<p>Jean had to laugh too, seeing the comic side of her
aged feeling, but it was true that she felt a new sense
of responsibility when they left New York for Elmhurst.
The Saturday following their departure, the
first carload of household goods left Sandy Cove. It
had been a difficult job, weeding out the necessities
from the luxuries, as Kit expressed it. Many a semi-luxury
was slipped in by the girls on the plea that
Father might need it, or would miss it. Kit had managed
to save all the furniture from the study on this
excuse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Books and pictures are necessities,&rdquo; she declared
firmly, saving a still life done in water colors. &ldquo;This,
for instance, has always hung over the desk, hasn&rsquo;t it?
Could we separate them? I guess not. In it goes, Doris,
and see that you handle it with care. There&rsquo;s one thing
that we can take up with us and nothing can get it
away from us, either, that&rsquo;s atmosphere. Even if we
have to live in a well-shingled, airy barn, we can have
atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t laugh, Tommy,&rdquo; Doris admonished as he
dove into a mass of pillows. &ldquo;Kit doesn&rsquo;t mean that
sort of atmosphere. She means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean living with a copper vase. Miss Carruthers,
our teacher at the art class, told us a story the other
day about a woman she knew who was married to a
band leader and they had to travel continually, living
only in hotel rooms. She had a copper vase that she
took wherever they went. She said even one familiar
object like that, in strange surroundings, was the difference
between living and just existing. Just think of
Dad&rsquo;s face if we can blindfold him, lead him into a
lovely sunny room up there, take off the bandage, and
let him find himself right in his own study just as he
had it down here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;And as long as he&rsquo;s going to stay in bed or lie on
a couch he&rsquo;ll never know what the rest of the house is
like,&rdquo; added Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not going to stay in bed, we hope,&rdquo; answered
their mother, catching up Tommy for a quick
kiss, and for once he didn&rsquo;t protest. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re
going up there, to get him out into the sunlight as soon
as possible, so he&rsquo;ll get quite well again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit passed down the stairs completely covered with
the burden which she bore. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got all the drapes,
tablecloths, slipcovers, and underneath this load is
me,&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;We may have to turn the attic into a
cosy corner before we get through. It&rsquo;s all in the effect,
isn&rsquo;t it, Mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that Dad sold your car, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Doris
remarked. Doris was the farsighted one of the family.
&ldquo;Bruce Pearson says he knows we could have gotten
fifteen hundred for it just as easy as not. His mother
told him it was worth every penny of fifteen hundred,
and Dad let it go for eight hundred just because he
liked the Phelpses.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doris, dear, eight hundred cash is worth more
than fifteen hundred promised,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig said,
smiling over at her. &ldquo;And the car is several years old.
I&rsquo;m glad with all my heart that Mr. Phelps bought it,
because they&rsquo;ve been wanting one very much, and the
children will get so much pleasure out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children looked down at her admiringly, almost
gloatingly, as she sat back contentedly in the low
slipper chair in the sunny window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, you&rsquo;re a regular darling, truly you are,&rdquo;
Kit exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so big and fine and sympathetic
that you make us feel like two cents sometimes
when we&rsquo;ve been selfish. Why do you look so happy
when everything&rsquo;s going topsy-turvy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig held up a letter that Tommy had just
brought in from the mailbox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebecca writes that Father stood the trip well and
has slept every night since they reached Maple Grove.
Isn&rsquo;t that worth all the automobiles in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eight hundred dollars in cash had been a helpful
addition to their bank account. During the past
few weeks, the girls and Tommy had learned what it
meant to consider money, something they had never
given a thought to before. While they had never been
rich, they never had wanted, and never a suggestion
of retrenching on expenses until now. Once they understood
the situation, however, they all seemed to
enjoy helping to solve the family problem. For several
days Tommy had appeared to have something on his
mind. Finally, he came in smiling and opened his
hand, disclosing a ten-dollar bill. Kit staggered over
to fall into a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy, you mustn&rsquo;t give your poor old sister sudden
shocks like that in these days,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Where did you find that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sold Jiggers to Bruce Pearson,&rdquo; Tommy replied,
his eyes shining like stars. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been asking and asking
for him ever since I got him, and now I&rsquo;ve done it.
There&rsquo;s ten dollars I got all by myself to help Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Kit nor Doris spoke, but they regarded the
youngest member of the family with the deepest pride
and affection. Jiggers was a cocker spaniel puppy, the
special property of Tommy, and they knew just what
it took to part with him. Mrs. Craig took the crisp
green bill from Tommy&rsquo;s hand, while the tears slowly
gathered on her lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly splendid of you, dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>Tommy beamed and put his hands into his pockets.
The family noticed that he kept carefully avoiding
the window for outside was where Jiggers&rsquo; little kennel
had stood. There are some things the heart cannot
quite bear.</p>
<p>Much debating was held over the piano. The children
loved it and declared it could not be true economy
to part with it. It was a baby grand that they had
had ever since the Riverside apartment days in town.
Doris said she wanted to continue her practicing even
if she couldn&rsquo;t take any more lessons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Mom,&rdquo; Kit said finally, &ldquo;you know what I
told you about the copper vase. That precious old
piano is a copper vase and we&rsquo;ll starve our inmost souls
if we try to live without it. Why, we&rsquo;ve loved it and
pounded it for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was boxed and shipped to Elmhurst as a copper
vase, together with many another disguised necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve turned into arrant smugglers,&rdquo; Mrs.
Craig wrote her husband. &ldquo;And I cannot blame them,
because I catch myself doing the same thing, packing
things I should not take, and making myself believe
they are essential. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t see where we are
ever to put everything in a farmhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Rebecca brightened up and smiled when that portion
of the letter was read aloud to her. She was sitting
in a straight-backed, split-bottomed chair by the south
window in the sitting room, sorting out morning-glory
and nasturtium seeds and putting them into old baking
powder cans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess Margie&rsquo;ll buck up some when she sees the
house we think she will like,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">7. Country Bound</span></h2>
<p>While some of the Long Island farms had begun to
look faintly green by the end of March, not a blade or
a leaf was unfurled anywhere around Elmhurst.
There was a feeling of spring in the air with a promise
of buds ready to open.</p>
<p>Jean put on her yellow topper, tied a scarf over her
head and put on a pair of pigskin gloves. She was waiting
for Matt to drive around from the garage with the
car and Ella Lou, Becky&rsquo;s big tan and white collie.
Matt was Rebecca&rsquo;s hired help, smooth-faced and
lean, somewhere in the neighborhood of fifty. He took
care of three horses and two cows and worked the farm
with outside help in busy seasons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>Ella Lou was a lovable dog who followed Becky
wherever she went and since Jean&rsquo;s arrival, she had
taken to tagging her footsteps too. She knew every
road in the township. Not a thing could be changed
that Ella Lou did not take note of the fact the next
time she passed by.</p>
<p>Today when Matt drove up with her, she was standing
in the back seat with her muzzle hanging out of
the window. She acted as wise and knowing as could
be, turning her head around to look at Jean and barking
just as if she was saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going after them
at last, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becky stood at the screened pantry window, mixing
pie crust. She leaned down and called some last advice
as Jean got into the car and adjusted the rear view
mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park beside the express office, Jeannie. There&rsquo;s
usually plenty of room to park there. And have the
girls and Tommy sit on the back seat &rsquo;cause them
springs are kind of giving way, and your Mother&rsquo;s
nervous. And bring up a bulb for the hall light from
the Mill Company Store. No, never mind,&rdquo; just as
Jean stepped on the starter, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause they don&rsquo;t carry
them, come to think of it. Goodbye. I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;ll have any trouble finding the way. Just keep on
the main highway and you&rsquo;ll get there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Jean laughed and waved her hand. It was the first
time she had driven since she had come to Elmhurst
and Becky was a little apprehensive about letting her
go alone.</p>
<p>Maple Grove stood just at the crossroads, a white
comfortable-looking house, one-and-a-half stories
high, with a long low &ldquo;ell&rdquo; hitched on to the back, and
a white woodshed leaning up against it for company.</p>
<p>Four great rock maples grew before its spacious
lawn like a row of Titan sentinels. The Baltimore
orioles and robins nested in them and contended with
the chipmunks for squatter&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>The house stood on a hill that faced the sunset.
Down from the orchard sloped corn fields and rye
fields. Below the winding white road was a deep ravine
where a brook ran helter-skelter by hilly pastures
until it slipped away into the cool shade of a quiet
glen, sweet-scented with hemlock and spruce.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>In the distance, hill after hill rose in mellowed
beauty, each seeming to lean in sisterly fashion against
the next taller one. The course of Little River could
be traced down through the valley by its fringe of willows
and alders. For perhaps fifteen miles it rambled,
winding in and out around little islands, dodging old
submerged trees that lifted skeleton arms in protest,
spreading out above some old rock dam into a tiny
lake, then dashing like some wild thing being chased
through a mill run and out again into low, moist
meadows, thick with flag and rushes.</p>
<p>At a point about a mile below the house stood the
old Barlow lumber mill. Ella Lou barked at a dog as
they passed by. Jean drove leisurely, knowing she had
plenty of time. Once she put on the brakes suddenly
when she saw a shadowy brown shape that skitted
across the road in front of the car. She wondered
whether it was a rabbit or a muskrat. Already she was
catching the country spirit. Little objects of everyday
life held a meaning for her and she found herself
watching eagerly for new surprises as she drove along
the old river road. How the kids would love it all, she
thought, with a little tightening of her throat. It
might be a little lonesome at first, but surely it was,
as Becky said, a peaceful countryside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The final decision on the new home site was to be
left to her mother. Several places had been selected
with a leaning toward Woodhow, but, as Becky suggested,
Margie must be left unbiased to form her own
opinion, although according to her way of thinking,
no sensible person with half their wits could pass over
the merits of Woodhow, or the wonderful opportunities
it presented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to rack and ruin and it fairly cries out
for somebody to take hold of it and get it in shape,&rdquo;
she had said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what I&rsquo;d drive by it if
I were you, Jeannie, on your way back from the station,
even if it is a little out of your way, just to see the
look on your mother&rsquo;s face when she sees it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a drive of seven miles down to Nantic, the
nearest railroad station. Jean made it in good time and
parked beside the express office, as Becky had suggested.
Already, it appeared, Mr. Briggs, the station
master, knew Jean, and smiled over at the trim, city-like
figure pacing up and down on the platform waiting
for the Willimantic train. This was the side line
up to Providence that connected with the Boston express
from New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expecting some of your family up?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Briggs pleasantly. Nobody could say that friendly interest
in strangers and their affairs was not evinced
around Nantic. It was part of the joy of life to Mr.
Briggs to locate their general intentions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and sisters and brother,&rdquo; Jean answered
happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Figure on staying awhile, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded rather proudly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to live
here. We&rsquo;re Miss Craig&rsquo;s cousins. You&rsquo;ll have the
freight car up with our goods this week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Briggs encouragingly.
&ldquo;Yes, I knew you belonged to Becky. I&rsquo;ve known
Becky herself since she was knee-high to a toadstool.
There comes your local.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Around the hillside bend of track came the train,
the wonderful train that was bringing Mother and
Doris and Kit and Tommy up out of the world of uncertainty
and trouble into this haven of blossoming
hopes. It seemed to Jean as if seconds turned to
minutes. She wanted to stretch out both her arms to
it as it slowed down and puffed, but there on the last
car she caught a glimpse of Kit, one foot all ready to
hop off, waving one hand and hanging on with the
other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mom darling,&rdquo; Jean cried joyously, once she
had them all safe on the platform. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful
up here, and Dad&rsquo;s looking better every day. He sits
up for a while now, and the old doctor told us the only
thing that ailed him was a little distemper. Isn&rsquo;t that
a riot? Where are your trunks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this was Mr. Brigg&rsquo;s cue to come forward, hat
in hand, and be introduced, so he took the baggage
under his own personal supervision. It appeared that
you never could tell anything about when trunks were
liable to show up once they got started for Nantic, but,
barring accidents, they&rsquo;d come up on the six o&rsquo;clock
train, and there wasn&rsquo;t a bit of use putting any reliance
on that either, &rsquo;cause they might not show up till
the milk train next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll like it up here,&rdquo; was his parting remark,
as they drove up the hill road, and Kit called
back that they liked it already, much to Mr. Brigg&rsquo;s
delight.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig sat on the front seat, both as the place of
honor and in remembrance of Rebecca&rsquo;s warning
against the back springs. At the top of the hill Jean
stopped the car, so they could look back at the little
town. There was the huge one-story stone mill, covering
acres of ground, with immense ventilators looking
like those on steamships or like strange uprearing
heads of prehistoric reptiles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The little crooked main street could be traced by
its lines of buildings, and back in a mass of trees stood
the old French convent. Scattered everywhere were
the houses of the mill workers, all of a uniform pattern,
painted white with green blinds, and a patch of
green yard to each.</p>
<p>Jean, flushed and proud of her responsibility,
turned to pat Ella Lou&rsquo;s head, then started the car
and headed for home. The maple buds were swelling
and looked rosy red against the thickets of dark shiny
green laurel. Behind them rose slim lines of white
birches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it, Jeannie?&rdquo; asked Doris. Just then the
road came out on another hilltop overlooking the big
reservoir. &ldquo;Oh, look, look, kids,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
like a bit of out West, Mom? All those rocks and
pines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have these gorgeous hills than all the
mountains going,&rdquo; Kit declared with her usual forcefulness.
&ldquo;We seem to be going up higher and higher
all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are,&rdquo; Jean told her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a steady rise from
New London to Norwich, then up to our own Quinnebaug
hills. Are you warm enough, Mom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craig happily. &ldquo;Though it is
ever so much cooler here than on Long Island, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got an open log fire in your room all ready
for you,&rdquo; Jean replied. &ldquo;You can just sit and toast
away to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For gosh sake, who ever had the courage to carry
all the rocks for these stone walls?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the stones that were ploughed up when
the land was cultivated,&rdquo; answered Jean. &ldquo;The land
here is particularly stony, so instead of wooden fences,
the farmers use the stones they uncover for marking
off their boundaries. Our house will probably have
them too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how you talk, dear,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Craig.
&ldquo;When we haven&rsquo;t even a home yet. You&rsquo;d think there
was a baronial estate waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; Jean answered mysteriously. &ldquo;Becky
and I think that we&rsquo;ve found the right place. Dad
hasn&rsquo;t seen it, of course, but I found it, and Becky said
we couldn&rsquo;t get it because somebody&rsquo;d died, and it
had gone to people out West.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which gave our precious old Jean a chance to
delve into mystery,&rdquo; Kit suggested. &ldquo;Yes, yes, go on,
kid. You&rsquo;re killing us with suspense. What did you
find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I found him,&rdquo; said Jean, enthusiastically. &ldquo;He
lives away out West in Saskatoon, and has never even
seen this place, so he&rsquo;s willing to sell it for almost
nothing, $4,000, and even that includes the water
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit shook her head deploringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to the poor child, Mom. She chats of thousands
as if they were split peas and she was making
soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Kit. He&rsquo;ll rent it for sixty-five dollars a
month, timber rights reserved excepting for our own
use, and we can sell the hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many rooms, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven,&rdquo; replied Jean. &ldquo;They call it Woodhow and
I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; Doris inquired cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can we move in?&rdquo; Tommy asked practically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can see the roof, I think, as soon as we
get up to the top of Peck&rsquo;s Hill. I&rsquo;ll stop then. It&rsquo;s fearfully
lonesome, and maybe you&rsquo;d rather be in the village.
Becky says that some people do say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make her shut up,&rdquo; Kit exclaimed. &ldquo;Jean, you&rsquo;re
talking exactly like Becky. Isn&rsquo;t she, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear. Go right on,&rdquo; comforted Mrs.
Craig, smiling at the eager young face beside her.
Three weeks at Maple Grove had surely taken a lot
of the spread out of Jean&rsquo;s sails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be one bit lonely. It&rsquo;s about a
mile from Maple Grove, and half a mile from Mr.
Peck&rsquo;s place down the valley, and the mail goes right
by the door. And there&rsquo;s an old ruined stone mill on
an island, and a waterfall, and a bridge, and big pines
along the terrace in the front yard. It does need painting,
I suppose, and shingling in spots, and the porch
lops a little bit where it needs shoring up, Matt told
me&mdash;&rdquo; Jean stopped for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Specify Matt,&rdquo; Doris asked mildly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know a thing about Matt, Jeannie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the hired man, and he can do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Craig, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you
realize that there must be something wrong with it or
it never would be rented for such a sum.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there is,&rdquo; Jean replied promptly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far
from the railroad or village, and the mill burned down
six years ago, and the owner died from the shock of
losing everything he had, and there it stands, going to
rack and ruin, Becky says, waiting for the Craigs to
appear and turn it into a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about school?&rdquo; asked Kit suddenly.</p>
<p>Jean waved her hand grandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants a school out here? But if you&rsquo;re so set
on one, there&rsquo;s a school over at the Gayhead crossroads.
There&rsquo;s a school bus that picks the kids up and
takes them home again at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean has us all moved and settled already,&rdquo; Mrs.
Craig said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d like to be near where Rebecca
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there it is,&rdquo; Jean exclaimed happily. Ella
Lou pricked up her ears and started to whine excitedly.
Down one little hill, up another, over a culvert,
and suddenly there appeared white chimneys
rising above an apple orchard at the top of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; she said, pointing to it with her hand.
&ldquo;Seven miles from nowhere, but right next door to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">8. The House on the Hill</span></h2>
<p>The following morning Miss Craig said she thought
she would drive down to Woodhow with Margaret
Ann herself, and they&rsquo;d look it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you children feel like coming down, why don&rsquo;t
you walk over. You can take the short cut through the
woods. It&rsquo;s not far. Like enough you&rsquo;ll find some
bloodroot out by now and saxifrage too. Don&rsquo;t be like
Jean, though. The other day she came up from the
brook and said she&rsquo;d found a calla lily, and it was just
skunk cabbage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>So the girls and Tommy took the short cut through
the woods. They were just beginning to show signs of
spring. The trees were bare, but under the dry leaves
they found the new life springing. It was all new and
interesting to them. Down at the Cove they had been
in a beautiful part of Long Island but it was all restricted
property. Here the woods and meadows
spread for miles in every direction. Every pasture bar
seemed to invite one to climb over it and explore. And
where the woods ended in rocky pastures and wide
spreading fields, they came out to a spot where they
overlooked Woodhow and its grounds.</p>
<p>Becky and Mrs. Craig were there before them. The
side door stood hospitably open and Ella Lou was
lying on the front porch just as though she belonged
there. It was a curiously interesting old place. First of
all, a rock wall enclosed the grounds, with rock columns
at the two entrance gates. These were wide, for
the drive entered on one side, wound around the
house, and came out on the other road, as the house
stood at a corner.</p>
<p>The house itself looked like a glorified farmhouse,
although it was hard to place it in the history of architecture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps it started out to be Mid-Victorian
with that general squareness and the porch,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Craig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t Mid-Victorian, Mother darling,&rdquo; Jean
interposed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Reaction Period in New England.
First of all none of the Puritan Women had any
time to sit out on porches, so all the houses were made
plain-faced. Then after the war they began to turn
their minds to lighter things, so they stuck a cupola
up here, and tacked on a little porch there, and gave
the windows fancy eyebrows, and little scalloped
wooden lace ruffles along the edges of the eaves. Isn&rsquo;t
that so, Becky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, Jeannie,&rdquo; laughed Becky, &ldquo;maybe
you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;d say, though, it was mostly a hankering
after modernization. I don&rsquo;t set much store by it myself,
so long as I&rsquo;ve got plenty of flowering shrubs
around a house, and climbing vines. That makes me
think, you&rsquo;ve got a sight of them here, flowering
quince and almond, and peonies, and all sorts of hardy
annuals. There used to be a big border of them, I remember,
at the back of the house, and behind it was
an old-fashioned rose garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rose garden!&rdquo; Kit and Doris gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see if we can find it,&rdquo; cried Jean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Back they went to find it, and after hunting diligently
through hazel bushes and upspringing weeds,
they found one terrace that dipped into a sunken
space once walled in. Now the tumbled gray rocks had
half fallen down, and some were sunken in the earth.
But still they found some old rose bushes, and several
of the large bushes looked hopeful. There was a
flagged walk with myrtle growing up between the
stones, and a tumble-down arbor that Tommy declared
looked exactly like a shipwrecked pilothouse
off some boat.</p>
<p>Doris, sitting down on the broad front steps, was
listening to the music of falling water in the distance
and the wind overhead in the great, slumberous pines.
There were four of these, two on each side of the long
terrace, with rock maples down near the rock wall and
several pear and cherry trees. Along the terrace were
flower beds, three on each one, outlined with clam
shells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Trowbridge used to have gladiolus set out in
those beds, with pansies and sweet alyssum set around
the edges, and outside again, old-hen-and-her-chickens.
They looked real pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who was Miss Trowbridge, Becky?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Craig. She sat beside Jean, her hands clasped lightly in
her lap, her hat lying beside her. There was a look of
content on her face, a look that had been a stranger
there for many months. Tommy tossed a spray of half-blossomed
cherry twigs in her lap and ran away again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was sister to the Trowbridge that owned the
mills. She married some man out in Canada, lived
awhile out there, then gave up and died. She never
did have much backbone that I could see, but she
loved flowers. Did you notice a big glass bay window
off the dining room? She called that her conservatory.
I remember asking her once if it was her &lsquo;conversationary,&rsquo;
and how she did laugh at me! Well, every
one can&rsquo;t be expected to know everything. It&rsquo;s all I
can do to keep up with Elmhurst these days. Her name
was Francelia and she married a McRae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who had the place after she and her brother
died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca never believed in directness when it came
to genealogies. She delighted in them, and would slip
her glasses down to the middle of her long nose, elevate
her chin, and go after a family tree like a government
forester.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, according to my way of thinking, it should
belong to Sally Hancock and her brother Buzzy. His
name&rsquo;s Seth, but they call him Buzzy. Their mother
was Luella Trowbridge, sister to Francelia and Tom
who owned the mills, but she married Clint Hancock
against everybody&rsquo;s word, and her father cut her off in
his will, and never saw her from the day she was married.
Tom did the same, but Francelia used to go over
and see her after Sally and Buzzy were born. They live
down near Nantic. You must have passed the house,
little bit of a gray one with rambler roses all over it,
and a well sweep at one side. The property went to
Francelia after Tom died, and she had one boy. He&rsquo;s
out in Northwest Canada now and don&rsquo;t give a snap
of his finger for this place, when there&rsquo;s Sally and
Buzzy loving it to death and can&rsquo;t hardly walk on the
grass. Still, I suppose if they went to law, they&rsquo;d get
nothing out of it after all the lawyers had been satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit and Doris listened open-eyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, Becky,&rdquo; exclaimed Kit, &ldquo;how on
earth do you ever manage to keep track of all of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep track of them? Land, child, that ain&rsquo;t anything
after you&rsquo;ve been to school with them and lived
neighbors all your life. You children will like Sally
and her brother, and maybe you can help put a little
happiness into their lives, poor youngsters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mom, I love this place already,&rdquo; whispered
Jean contentedly, snuggling close to her mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, dear?&rdquo; Mrs. Craig smiled down into her
eldest child&rsquo;s face. For some reason she always waited
for Jean&rsquo;s judgment and opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, because it isn&rsquo;t really a farm and still we
can have a garden and sell the hay and get out wood
and raise all we need for ourselves. I don&rsquo;t think we
can do much else the first year, can we, Becky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do all that you&rsquo;ll be getting along fine. I&rsquo;m
going to start you off chicken raising with a lot of little
ones from my incubator. You can buy all you want for
ten cents apiece, and if you get about fifteen last year
pullets and a rooster, you&rsquo;ve got your barnyard family
all started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d like to take care of the incubator chickens.
May I, please?&rdquo; begged Tommy instantly. &ldquo;I think
one of the saddest things in life is to be hatched without
a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sympathetic Tommy,&rdquo; laughed Kit, catching him
down on the grass and rolling him over. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s going
to adopt all the chickens and gosh knows what else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep bees,&rdquo; Doris announced dramatically,
yet with a certain aloofness in her manner. &ldquo;I
want a garden and bees that bring me home the honey
from the clover fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; Jean exclaimed, hugging her knees, and
rocking to and fro contentedly. &ldquo;You always select
such royal occupations, Doris. I shall be the middleman
of the farm. I am going to find markets for all you
raise. I&rsquo;ll make the farm pay expenses. We&rsquo;ll need a
trailer to attach to the rear bumper of the car to hold
the produce. I think we ought to go into the village
soon and see about getting one. I want the place, don&rsquo;t
you Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall love it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craig, lifting her
face to the swaying pine boughs overhead. &ldquo;I wish
that I could stay here now and not have to go away at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get started,&rdquo; said Becky. She rose from
the porch step. &ldquo;Ella Lou&rsquo;s begun to get restless and
that&rsquo;s to let me know it&rsquo;s almost noon. She can always
tell the time when the sun gets high.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure Mom wants the place, don&rsquo;t you, Jean?&rdquo;
Kit asked as they went up through the woods towards
home. &ldquo;All the time we were going through the house
I could see every bit of our furniture in the right
places there. And there&rsquo;s so much room that Dad will
hardly know the difference between this place and the
old one at the Cove. He could have that room overlooking
the valley on the second floor. You can see the
big brown stone dam from there and the ruins of the
mill, and hear the falling water. I wish we had time to
climb out over the old dam to the mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than living right in a village,&rdquo; Jean answered,
pushing aside the young birches that crowded
the way. &ldquo;I rather dreaded that somehow. Everybody&rsquo;d
want to know all about us right off, and why we came
up, and what ailed Dad, and everything else. I hope,
though, Mother won&rsquo;t be lonely here. You know, kids,
it&rsquo;s lonely for a woman like her, where Becky doesn&rsquo;t
mind it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to pitch in and make up to her for
everything she&rsquo;s left behind,&rdquo; said Doris solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Dorrie.&rdquo; Kit put her arm around her
sister and squeezed her affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a question of system,&rdquo; Jean thought aloud,
her hands deep in the pockets of her gray flannel
slacks. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make a business of living, and
learn how to do things we hate to do with the least
effort.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for Pete&rsquo;s sake, you&rsquo;re just a bluffer, Jean
Craig,&rdquo; exclaimed Doris suddenly, &ldquo;just a bluffer.
Anyone would think to hear you talk that you actually
enjoyed going without things. Of course when
we&rsquo;re with Mother and Dad, or even Becky, we have
to put on a whole lot, but when we&rsquo;re alone I do think
we might at least be sincere with ourselves. We all
know how we feel at heart about this sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of thing?&rdquo; asked Kit, on the offensive
instantly. &ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Giving up everything we&rsquo;ve been used to, and
living out here in the woods. I&rsquo;m going to miss the
girls most of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t like losing everything any better
than you do, Doris,&rdquo; Jean said soothingly. &ldquo;Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pat me,&rdquo; retorted Doris, shaking off her
hand. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m selfish, and I&rsquo;m beginning to feel
sorry I said anything. Only it does look so bleak and
forlorn here somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you have to do a thing, why, you just have
to do it, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Kit declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to make
up your mind you&rsquo;re going to like it, besides, I really
think I am. Look at that cow ahead of us. It must have
strayed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Through the birches ahead they could see some object
obstructing the narrow path, its back towards
them. Large as a cow it was, and reddish brown, but in
place of short horns, this animal had spreading antlers,
and Jean caught sight of its round puff of a tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, kids, it&rsquo;s a deer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At her voice the deer started and pushed into the
thick underbrush until it came to a stone wall. They
watched it rise and clear it at a bound like a thoroughbred
horse, its knees bent under, its head held high.
Then it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that simply breathtaking, but I mean,
simply divine? Wish we could tame some, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed.</p>
<p>Tommy ran along the path ahead of them. &ldquo;I like
this ever so much better than the Cove,&rdquo; he called.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so wild and free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>They paused at a spur of land that looked out over
the long valley. Little River flowed in a winding
course marked by alders and willows. Now that there
was no foliage to obscure the view, they could catch a
glimpse here and there of a red roof or a white
chimney. There was the Smith mill, then the old
white Murray homestead with its weather vane standing
on a little hill like a big yardarm at large. Then
came their own old ruined mill, half tumbling down,
with empty window casings, all overgrown with woodbine
and poison ivy. Farther up the valley one caught
the hum of another mill, purring musically in a sort
of crescendo scale ending in a snappy zip as the log
broke.</p>
<p>As they neared Maple Grove, Jean exclaimed suddenly,
&ldquo;I just seem to have the feeling that we all belong
here somehow! I know we&rsquo;re going to love it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">9. Fateful Moment</span></h2>
<p>That very night a council was held of what Mr. Craig
termed &ldquo;the Board of Amateur Experts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I need Matt in here for support,&rdquo; he said
laughingly from his favorite resting place, the old-fashioned,
high-backed couch in the sitting room.</p>
<p>Maple Grove was a large, comfortable house. There
was a front entrance, a side entrance and a well room
at the back of the kitchen. There was a parlor and a
front bedroom, a side bedroom and a big sunny sitting
room that was dining room also, and finally the
old kitchen with its Dutch oven and hooks in the ceiling
for hanging up smoked beef and bacon sides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>Not that Becky ever used the Dutch oven nowadays
except to store things away in. She had instead a fine
modern electric stove over which she hovered like a
sorceress from five A. M. to eleven A. M., producing
such marvels of cookery that held the girls spellbound&mdash;raised
doughnuts with jam inside and powdered
sugar outside, apple turnovers made with Peck&rsquo;s
Pleasants and rich Baldwins, ginger cookies, large as
saucers with scalloped edges, soft and rich as butterscotch,
and pies, with rich, flaky crust and delectable
filling in endless varieties. Jean declared that she had
learned more about cooking in the few weeks she had
lived at Maple Grove than in all her life before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s cooking and cooking, girls,&rdquo; Rebecca
had replied placidly, fishing for brown doughnuts
with her long, hand-wrought iron fork. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one thing
to cook when you&rsquo;ve got everything to do with, and
quite another when you are eternally figuring out how
to make both ends meet. Of course, I don&rsquo;t have to
do that. Land knows there&rsquo;s plenty to eat and more
too, but it&rsquo;s all plain food, and you&rsquo;ve got to learn how
to toss vegetables around in forty different ways out
here if you want any variety.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>It was that evening that the Board of Amateur Experts
discussed everything that lay ahead of them from
the said vegetables to chickens, cows, horses, and farm
implements.</p>
<p>Mr. Craig had seemed relieved when he was sure
that his wife approved of Woodhow. It was near
Maple Grove and Rebecca, he said, and they would
surely need both many times during their first experimental
year in the country. Also, it was on the mail
route, and not too large a place in acreage for them to
handle. There was a good apple orchard, a little run-down,
but it would be all right with pruning and
proper care. Besides, there were four good pear trees,
two large cherry trees, white hearts and red, and three
crabapple trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess if you hunt around, you might find some
quinces too, and plenty of berries and currants,&rdquo; Rebecca
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been let go to waste the past few years,
and it&rsquo;ll take a year or more to get it back into shape.
You&rsquo;d better write out West and get a three-year lease,
with option of purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t think of buying it, even with a GI
loan from the government,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig demurred,
&ldquo;but we might try the three-year lease. What do you
think, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should write tonight,&rdquo; Mr. Craig told her confidently.
&ldquo;Even if I should gain my health completely,
we could still stay up here summers, and you all would
enjoy it, I know. Look at Tommy&rsquo;s red cheeks, and
Jean looks like another girl. If I keep on much longer
on Becky&rsquo;s cooking, I expect to be mowing hay in the
lower meadows by July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the letter was written, the wonderful letter
freighted with so many hopes. All the youngsters escorted
Mrs. Craig down to the mailbox at the crossroads
the next noon. It was truly a fateful moment, as
Kit remarked solemnly. So much depended upon the
nature of the answer from far-off Saskatoon. Perched
on the fence rail Tommy began to whistle loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name, Mom?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph McRae,&rdquo; Jean answered for her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, really, Tommy,&rdquo; protested Doris, &ldquo;if
you could just see how ridiculous you look on that
fence rail, you&rsquo;d come down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tommy ignored her and kept to the rail all the
same, whistling. Even Kit felt the inspiration of the
moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I love these April mornings! You can smell
everything that&rsquo;s sweet and new in the air, can&rsquo;t you,
Mom? And I found arbutus buds down in the pines
too, and an old crow&rsquo;s nest, and the crocuses are up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig lifted her face to the blue sky with its
great white clouds that drifted up from the south and
sighed contentedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the mailman down the wildwood
way,&rdquo; Jean called from the curve of the road.</p>
<p>Already they had grown to watch for mail as the one
real event of the day. Mr. Ricketts, the rural free delivery
carrier, was a typical product of a small community,
with his cap pushed back on his head, a smile
of perpetual well-being on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like we&rsquo;d get a spell of fine weather,&rdquo; he
called. &ldquo;Tell Miss Craig I noticed a postcard for her
about her subscription being up for her floral
monthly, and if she ain&rsquo;t going to renew hers, I&rsquo;ll send
in my own for this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now just hear that,&rdquo; exclaimed Becky when she
was given the message. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s read my floral monthly
regularly coming along the route. Well, I don&rsquo;t know
as I mind. He&rsquo;s a real good mail carrier anyhow, and
all men have failings. But Tom Ricketts knows better
than to read my floral monthly without so much as by
your leave. But I&rsquo;ll renew it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have read the postcard too,&rdquo; said Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it?&rdquo; Becky sniffed audibly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see
anything get by them down at that post office. They
know a sight more about you than you do yourself.
Postmaster Willetts could sit down singlehanded and
write a history of the local inhabitants of this town
just from memory and postcards, I don&rsquo;t doubt a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very next day the girls and Tommy went again
to Woodhow. The keys were at Mr. Weaver&rsquo;s, the
next house down the road from Maple Grove. It
was a rambling gray house sitting far back from the
road and facing the western hills. Philip Weaver lived
there alone. He was ninety-one and had had six wives,
Rebecca told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though mercy knows, nobody holds that against
him. It was a compliment to the sex, I suppose, if he
could get them. And Uncle Philly&rsquo;s buried them all
reverently and properly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>They found the old man working at a carpenter&rsquo;s
bench out in the woodshed. His hair was gray and
curly and his upper lip clean-shaven. Tommy said he
looked like the pictures of Uncle Sam. He was tall and
lean and stoop-shouldered, but his blue eyes were full
of twinkles and he had the finest set of false teeth, Kit
remarked soberly, that she&rsquo;d ever seen, and the most
Winsome smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winsome? Philly Weaver Winsome?&rdquo; laughed Rebecca
when she heard it. &ldquo;Well, I must say, Kit, that
is the best description yet. Winsome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is,&rdquo; Kit protested, &ldquo;really winsome. He
gave us each a drink from his well and showed Jean
his Dutch tile stove and his grandfather&rsquo;s clock. And
he&rsquo;s got the cutest old chest out in that side hall, Rebecca.
I asked him how much he&rsquo;d take for it, and he
said no, he guessed he&rsquo;d better not, though it was
worth as much as two dollars and a half, but it had
been his great-grandmother&rsquo;s hope chest. Wasn&rsquo;t that
amusing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with the key and waving goodbye to the old
man at the top of the hill, they started down to the
crossroads. Already they called the house home. It was
so satisfying, Kit said, just to wander about the rooms
and plan. There was one large southeast room that
must be the living room. Back of this, opening out on
a wide side porch, was the dining room. On the opposite
side of the front hallway was a small room they
could use for a study. Between it and the kitchen was
a good-sized hallway lined with shelves and long
handy drawers beneath them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>It was the kitchen and attic, though, that the girls
lingered over most. The former extended across the
entire back of the house and Doris said there was room
enough to hold a dance in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you, Jeannie?&rdquo; Kit called. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re missing
thrills of discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jean was getting her own thrills. She had rolled
up the legs of her blue jeans and ventured down the
old winding cellar steps, groped around in the dark
until she found the outside doors and removed the big
wooden bar that held them. The stone steps outside
were green with moss, and an indignant toad hopped
back out of the sunlight when she threw open the
doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the moldy smell out of the cellar in a
few days,&rdquo; she told the others, rolling up her sleeves
and sitting down in the sunshine on the top step. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s a furnace down there, too. It looks old and
rusty, but it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Kit stood with her hands clasped behind her back,
looking up at the tall tapering pines. They were splendid
old trees, towering as high as the house itself.
Their branches spread out like great hoopskirts of
green. Underneath was a thick silky carpet of russet
needles, layer on layer from many seasons of growth.
Beyond the limits of the garden lay the strip of white
road, and across that came wide fields that seemed to
fall in long waves to meet the river. On all sides they
slipped away from the old house, their square borders
outlined with the gray rock walls, each with its brave
showing of springtime green, where every clambering
vine had sent forth leafy tendrils, and even the moss
had freshened up under the April showers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a couple of weeks more they&rsquo;ll all be green,&rdquo;
said Jean, her dark eyes bright with anticipation.
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll plough them and sow them, and they&rsquo;ll
grow and grow, kids, and turn a real golden harvest
over to us by fall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">10. New Home, New Friends</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Goods have come,&rdquo; called Mr. Ricketts from the
mailbox one morning. The pink freight card lay on
top, and he seemed as pleased as anyone to find it
there. &ldquo;Letter from out West too, I noticed, so I presume
you folks will be settled pretty soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost feel as if I ought to let him read what Mr.
McRae says,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig said amusedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so
friendly and interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she opened the letter, the girls gathered around
her chair, eager-eyed and curious to see what it contained.
Jean declared that she liked the handwriting
because it was firm and plain without any flourishes.
Kit was sure he used a stub pen and was rather morose
and dignified. Doris asked if she might keep the postage
stamp for a memento.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;You read it, dear. I&rsquo;d much rather you did,&rdquo; their
mother said, handing it over to Mr. Craig.</p>
<p>Rebecca was out in the buttery singing softly to
herself about some day when the mists had rolled in
splendor from the beauty of the hills, so there was just
their own family together as they listened anxiously
for the verdict. The letter ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,</span>
<span class="jr">April 4th</span></p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Craig, Elmhurst, Connecticut</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Craig: Your letter of March 28th received.
I should be very glad to rent the old house
down at Stony Eddy on a lease, but do not want to
let it go out of the family. Miss Craig can tell you
the conditions under which it came into my possession
and why I am not at liberty to part with it. If
you care to rent it at $65 a month, it is yours. Any
necessary repairs it may need I am willing to make.
I have never seen the property myself, but whatever
Miss Craig says about it will be satisfactory to
me, as she was my Aunt Trowbridge&rsquo;s dearest friend.</p>
<p>Hoping if you decide to take the place, you may be
happy there, I am,</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours sincerely,</span>
<span class="jr">RALPH McRAE.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ours,&rdquo; Jean breathed thankfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;I always felt that it was, somehow,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig
smiled happily around at her family. &ldquo;And I know
you&rsquo;ll like it, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know the place, I remember admiring it as
a boy. Besides, I&rsquo;d like anything up here. Why, I could
live out yonder in Becky&rsquo;s corncrib very comfortably
this summer if she&rsquo;d only let me,&rdquo; teased the invalid.
&ldquo;Better send a check out at once for the rent, Margie,
and get into it as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the third week in April when they drove
down in relays from Maple Grove and took possession
of the new home. There had been considerable repairing
to be done&mdash;painting and papering, mending
the water pipes and furnace, and cleaning out the
chimneys.</p>
<p>The goods had been brought up from Nantic by
Matt in the big hay wagon in four trips. Mrs. Craig
had wanted to hire a truck from Norwich, but Rebecca
said it was all nonsense with two big horses
standing idle in the barn just aching for work, and
Matt fussing around over frost still being in the
ground so he couldn&rsquo;t do any deep ploughing. So the
goods came up and were packed into the big front
room downstairs while the girls and Mrs. Craig went
back and forth settling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Matt&rsquo;s younger brother came to do the papering
and painting. He looked exactly like a young rooster,
Kit declared, all neck and legs, and he was fearfully
shy. She found immediate diversion in appearing before
him suddenly in her most abrupt manner to ask
his opinion anxiously on something, whereupon Shad
would blush intensely to the roots of his taffy-colored
hair, and splash paste blindly.</p>
<p>His name was Shadrach Farnum, but Shad suited
him to perfection. As Rebecca said, he did sort of run
to bone. But he could paint and paper well, and
gradually the rooms began to look different. The big
living room was covered with a soft gray that harmonized
well with their dark green and chartreuse
upholstered furniture. The bookcases were painted
the same shade of gray. Window seats were built
around the two bay windows, and the girls worked
hard making new chartreuse cushions and crisp white
curtains for the windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks so warm and friendly, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Doris
exclaimed when the big round table was brought in
and the copper lamp placed in the center. The copper
lamp was really an institution in the Craig family.
The girls had given it personal conduct from the Cove
on Long Island to Nantic. Jean had found it in an old
copper and brass shop in New York at a wonderful reduction,
and had carted it home herself in triumph.
The bowl was broad and low and squat, shaped a good
deal like a summer squash. The parchment shade was
perforated by hand with exquisite artistry into
strange Muscovite designs, through which the light
shone softly. When it was lighted the first evening in
the new home, Doris said she felt that everything was
complete.</p>
<p>The day after they really moved in, Rebecca drove
down with Ella Lou and some good advice, a large
brown crock of freshly baked beans and a loaf of
brown bread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;You need a good safe horse that you all can ride
and also use for work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sam Willetts
has a brown mare that seems just about the
ticket. I telephoned over to him this morning and
he&rsquo;ll sell her for $75, which isn&rsquo;t bad at all.
If you like, Margie, I&rsquo;ll call him up again as soon as
I get back and Buzzy Hancock can bring her over.
Buzzy&rsquo;s working for Mr. Willetts now, and the mare
used to belong to the Hancocks. She was a regular pet,
Sally said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig was sure it was a good plan and Rebecca
was instructed to close the bargain. So it was thus
Woodhow made the acquaintance of Buzzy Hancock,
destined to be a close friend before summer was over,
and always a family standby.</p>
<p>It was a little while after supper when Buzzy rode
up leading the mare behind his own horse, and they
all went out to look at her. Buzzy was about seventeen
and tall. He had rosy cheeks, blue eyes, curly brown
hair, and dimples so deep that Doris said it was a burning
shame to waste them on a boy.</p>
<p>He stood at the mare&rsquo;s head, patting her slender,
glossy neck and combing her mane with his fingers,
telling the girls and Tommy her history, how she had
belonged to Molly Bawn, their old mare, and how his
father had broken her to harness himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she never had to be really broken in. Sally and
I started riding her bareback when she was out in pasture
and she was just as tame as a kitten. She understands
anything you say to her. Mother hated to sell
her to Mr. Willetts, but we had to, and as I was working
for him, why, she didn&rsquo;t know any difference. She&rsquo;s
used to a good deal of petting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll all pet her,&rdquo; Jean promised. &ldquo;We must
get a saddle and harness. Do you know where we can
get some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down at Mr. Butterick&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Buzzy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the
man who handles all sorts of riding equipment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have wonderful people up here,&rdquo; Doris said
fervently. &ldquo;It seems as if whenever you want a certain
kind of a person, there he is waiting for you. Where
does Mr. Butterick live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down in Rocky Glen. Second house past the basket
weaver, Mr. Tompkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we go over there tomorrow, kids,&rdquo; Jean
suggested. &ldquo;Or do you have to take the mare over,
Buzzy, and let Mr. Butterick sort of fit her with a harness
and saddle? I wish I could put her in the barn
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get somebody to take care of her first,&rdquo;
Doris said practically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d feed her fish cakes and
doughnuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buzzy shifted his weight from one foot to the other
uneasily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose you folks think of taking anybody
on regularly, do you? Mother said I was to ask, and
say if you wanted me I might come up. It&rsquo;s nearer
home than Mr. Willetts&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s only Sally and
Mom at home, and they need me to do the chores after
I get home at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean hastily glanced at Kit for fear she wouldn&rsquo;t remember
all that Rebecca had told them about Buzzy
Hancock and his sister. But just then Mrs. Craig
stepped out on the side porch and smiled at Buzzy
until he turned red and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could come for about ten a month, Mother
thought,&rdquo; he added with much embarrassment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig thought ten was about right too, and
Buzzy rode away in the spring twilight. All the way
up the hill they heard him whistling <i>Stardust</i>. Although
the deal had been closed over the brown mare,
and the check reposed in Buzzy&rsquo;s overalls&rsquo; pocket, he
took her back with him, and promised to ride her over
in the morning so the Craigs should not have the care
of her overnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him what her name was,&rdquo; Tommy said,
&ldquo;and he told me they just called her Molly&rsquo;s Baby.
We must think up a better name than that. You know,
Mom, she looked over at me so wistfully when Buzzy
said she would have to go back overnight. I know she
wanted to stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The next addition to the place was the lot of chickens.
It had been agreed the first year that no large expenditures
should be made for anything, because it
was all more or less experimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to take care of Dad, and make him well
this first year,&rdquo; Jean told the others up in their room
one night.</p>
<p>At first the housework had proved to be the great
stumbling block in the way of perfect peace and daily
comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Mom, if you&rsquo;ll just say what you want
done, we&rsquo;ll do our best to oblige,&rdquo; Jean had promised
at the very beginning, but the girls had found themselves
tangled up in less than two days, treading on
each other&rsquo;s heels and losing their tempers, too.</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig laughed at them when she happened in
and found them all bickering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to learn teamwork,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;You must learn that when you put your bread to
rise it doesn&rsquo;t shape itself into loaves and hop into the
pans and walk over to the oven.&rdquo; Here Kit blushed
hotly, remembering how her first batch had risen to
the occasion beyond all expectations, and rambled
during the night all over the edge of the pan and the
arm of the chair she had set it on. &ldquo;And, Tommy,
darling, if you catch mice in traps alive, and then decide
to tame them, we&rsquo;ll have mice all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy had discovered a nice little brown prisoner
under the pantry shelf, had taken him out into the
rose garden and there let him go, all in a spirit of pity
that left Kit and Jean speechless.</p>
<p>Also, sundry noises having issued from his room at
night, the girls had started down the dark hall to investigate,
and had stepped on turtles which Tommy
had found sunning themselves on logs in the pond,
and had put into empty tomato cans and smuggled up
to his room for future humanitarian reference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, Mom,&rdquo; said Jean in a subdued voice, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
try to make fewer mistakes. With patience maybe
we&rsquo;ll learn how to do housework with one hand. I told
Kit to fix the bread a dozen times, but she wouldn&rsquo;t
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Buzzy came to the kitchen door, bare-headed
and smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sally said for me to tell you folks that she heard
Ma Parmelee had some good Plymouth Rocks for
sale. They&rsquo;re about as reliable a hen as you can get.
Ma&rsquo;s going to sell off everything and go to live with
her son down in Nantic. It&rsquo;s near toward where I live,
if you&rsquo;d like to drive over that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Craig thought it was a good idea, and that Jean
could drive her over. Jean went into the living room
to get the keys for the car from the desk and came
back. She and Buzzy walked out to the garage for the
car together.</p>
<p>As they walked along, Jean said, &ldquo;I wish spring
would hurry up and make up its mind to stay awhile.&rdquo;
Letters had come from some of the girls back at the
Cove that day and she felt a wave of loneliness and half
panic at what they had undertaken.</p>
<p>After Jean had backed the car out of the garage,
Buzzy helped her to attach the new trailer. At the
back door Jean tooted the horn and waited for her
mother to join them. While they were waiting Buzzy
loaded some burlap sacks into the trailer for the hens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better tie them to something when you start off,&rdquo;
he advised. &ldquo;They always flop around a lot in sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>It was a drive of about two and a half miles, up
through the hills. Each new road seemed to lead them
straight up to the edge of the world and then to dip
again and leave the clouds behind. The woods held a
haze of green now that hung over the distant hills like
a mist. Once a row of young quail blinked dizzily from
a pasture bar and fled at the noise of the approaching
car. And all at once there came the quick thud of hoofs
from a lane at the right of them, and a young girl
riding horseback waved for them to stop. She was
about as old as Kit, with friendly blue eyes and brown
hair brushed back from her face and fastened with a
silver clasp at the nape of her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; she said, blushing in a way that
seemed familiar to them, for it reminded them of
Buzzy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sally Hancock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">11. Jean Makes a Discovery</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re ever so glad to know you, Sally,&rdquo; Jean said
at once. &ldquo;Buzzy&rsquo;s told us all about you until we felt
that we really did know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally blushed deeper than ever, just as Buzzy did,
and brushed a fly off her horse&rsquo;s neck. She sat her horse
well, in a pair of navy-blue riding breeches and a
man&rsquo;s shirt open at the throat. Altogether both Mrs.
Craig and Jean approved of her at sight, for she
seemed like a girl edition of Buzzy himself.</p>
<p>Sally told them they were on the right road, and to
keep to the left after they passed the cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down the other way or I&rsquo;d ride along
and show you where it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must come down to see us when you can,
please. We&rsquo;re rather lonesome, since we&rsquo;re quite new
around here. Are there many boys and girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a few,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;And luckily there are
just about as many girls as boys. The Swedish girls
over on the old Ames place, and there are two French
girls near us. Their father&rsquo;s the carpenter, Mr. Chappelle.
Etoile&rsquo;s the older one and the little on they call
Tony. I&rsquo;ll be over to see you one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a darling, Mother?&rdquo; Jean exclaimed when
they drove on. &ldquo;I do hope she&rsquo;ll come down. Kit
would be crazy about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody would be,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Craig, still smiling.
&ldquo;You know, Jean, I think that you youngsters are
going to find a special work up here that only you can
do. A work among these boys and girls of our own
neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mom, our own neighborhood up here means
a radius of about ten miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so. Rebecca&rsquo;s old doctor covers twenty miles
and has been doing it for forty years. He knows all of
the families as if he were a census taker.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Jean thought for a minute. They were going up a
long hill and she shifted into second. &ldquo;There seem to
be so few real American girls up here, Mother,&rdquo; Jean
began slowly. &ldquo;I thought we&rsquo;d find ever so many, but
while I lived up at Maple Grove I rode around a good
deal, and you&rsquo;d be surprised how many foreigners are
up here. Becky told me the reason. The old families
die out, or the younger generation moves away to the
towns, and the foreigners buy up the old homesteads
cheaply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, you don&rsquo;t understand. There are all
sorts. French Canadians, and a Swedish family, and a
Polish family, and the old miller up the valley from us
used to be a Prussian sailor. Then there are the real
old families, of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking of confining your circle of acquaintances
to the old families, Jeannie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean laughed at the amusement in her mother&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, Mom. Still I suppose we must be
careful just moving into a new place like this. We
don&rsquo;t want to get intimate with everybody. You&rsquo;ll like
<i>some</i> of the old families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll like some of the new ones too. Have you
noticed, Jean, in driving around, that the houses
which are mostly unpainted and rather run-down-looking
belong to the old timers, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, probably of first settlers?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, there are some of the most interesting
stories about them too, how they came out&mdash;walked,
actually walked most of them&mdash;from the Massachusetts
Bay Colony when there was some sort of a breakup,
and a few dropped off here, and a few there, and they
settled in villages wherever they happened to stop. I
found a cemetery in the woods near Becky&rsquo;s, with old
slate gravestones, and dates away back to 1717.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see them, dear, but at the same time they
were foreigners too, or children of foreigners, immigrants
from a far land. Can&rsquo;t you understand what I
mean? These newer families are like new blood to the
country. It takes only a couple of generations to blend
them in, Jean, and they bring new strength to us.
Think what we get from the different nations. I remember
out in California I had a wonderful girl
friend whose people had been Polish exiles. That was
a strange group of exiles who sought a haven in our
land. There was Sienkiewicz, the great novelist, and
many whose names I forget. Wanda was my girl
friend&rsquo;s name and my mother and aunts didn&rsquo;t like me
to be so friendly toward her because she was a foreigner,
completely forgetting that they themselves
had come from foreign extraction. I think that you
children are very fortunate to be born in an age when
these queer old earth lines, these race barriers, are
being torn down and the idea of one world is coming
forth. Up here in our lonely hills, we are going to face
this same problem that all nations are coping with,
and we in our small way can help open the gates of
the future.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mother, I never heard you talk this way before,&rdquo;
Jean exclaimed. &ldquo;You always seemed just sweet
and feminine. I&mdash;why, somehow I never felt you were
interested in such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we mothers are not interested in them, who
should be?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes full of a beautiful tenderness
and compassion. &ldquo;And you are going to do
your share right here in Elmhurst, making a circle
that shall join together the hands of all these boys and
girls from different races. We&rsquo;ll give a party soon and
get acquainted with them all. Now let&rsquo;s pay attention
to chickens, for I think this must be the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Jean turned into a side drive leading around to a
house that stood well back from the road. As Jean
said afterwards, the house looked as if it had been outdoors
all its life, it was so weatherbeaten and gray.
&ldquo;Ma&rdquo; Parmelee bustled out to meet them, plump and
busy as one of her own Plymouth Rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve pullets and one rooster you want?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Well, I guess I can fix you up. I heard you folks
had moved in down yonder.&rdquo; She led the way out to
the big barn, followed by the chickens. The great
doors were wide open, and the barn floor was covered
lightly with wisps of hay. &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; scattered a measure of
grain over this, and let the hens scratch for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to work hard for what I get, and they ought
to, too,&rdquo; she said pleasantly. &ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll take any that
you like and put them into bags. I&rsquo;m going to sell you
my very best rooster. His name&rsquo;s Jim Dandy and he&rsquo;s
all of that. He&rsquo;s pure Rhode Island Red, and two
years old. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about hawks when
he&rsquo;s around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the chickens were all safely in the bags and
put into the trailer, &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; waved goodbye and told
them not to forget the Finnish family that was moving
into her house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to live with my married daughter, and
these poor things don&rsquo;t know a living soul up here. Do
drive over and speak to them as neighbors. There&rsquo;s a
man and his widowed sister and her children. All
God&rsquo;s folks, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finns,&rdquo; murmured Jean speculatively, as they
drove away. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a new blend to our community,
Mom. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to know someone from the
Scandinavian countries and Sally told me there is a
Swedish family here too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spring seemed to descend on the land all at once in
the next few days, as if she had quite made up her
mind to come and sit awhile, Becky said. One day the
earth still looked windswept and bare, and the next
there seemed to be a green sheen over the land and the
woods looked hazy and lacy with the delicate budding
leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>One night as Doris was out shutting up the hen
houses and filling the pigeons&rsquo; pan with water, she
stopped short, her head upraised eagerly like a fawn,
listening to a new sound away off along the edges of
the woods and deep down in the lower meadow where
the brook flowed. It sounded keenest and sweetest
over where the waters of the lake above the old dam
moved with soft low lapping among the reeds and
water grasses. Here it became a curiously shrill trilling
noise, subdued and yet insistent like the strumming
of muffled strings on a million tiny harps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the peep frogs,&rdquo; called Buzzy, coming up from
the barn with Buttercup&rsquo;s creamy contribution to the
family. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just waking up. That means it&rsquo;s
spring for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cute of them to try to tell us all about it,&rdquo;
Doris cried delightedly, and away she ran to the house
to insist that Kit and Jean and Tommy come out and
listen too. In the twilight they walked around the terraces
below the porch. Once Doris stopped below
their father&rsquo;s window to call up to him.</p>
<p>Day by day they would assure each other of his returning
strength and health. The country air and
utter restfulness of life as it ran here in channels of
peace were surely giving him back at least the power
to relax and rest. He slept as soundly as Tommy, all
night long, something he had not been able to do in
months, and his appetite was really getting to be quite
encouraging.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Sally paid her promised visit within a few days, and
from her the girls and Tommy received their first
real information about the other neighbors around
Elmhurst.</p>
<p>Buzzy was ploughing up the kitchen garden behind
the house and Jean, with Sally at her side, sat on the
low stone wall that separated it from the orchard,
poring over a seed catalogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love some zinnias and snapdragons and blue
delphiniums in big beds along the terraces,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Think of the splashes of blue up against those pines,
girls. Remember the Jefferies&rsquo; place back at the Cove.
Mrs. Jefferies paid her gardener a hundred dollars a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like the rare, rich red of radishes and beets
and scarlet runner beans better,&rdquo; Sally declared merrily.
&ldquo;We always lay out money on the food seeds first
and then what&rsquo;s left can go for flowers. Anyhow, when
you&rsquo;ve got heaps of roses and snowballs and syringas
and lilacs and things that keep coming up by themselves
every year, you don&rsquo;t need to buy very much.
Did you find the lilies of the valley down along the
north wall? Mother says they used to be beautiful
when she was a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The girls were silent, remembering what Rebecca
had told them of the romance of Luella Trowbridge.
But Tommy&rsquo;s curiosity got the better of his caution
and he coaxed Sally away to hunt for the lilies of the
valley hidden away under the hazel bushes.</p>
<p>It was Sally, too, who took them up the hill to the
rocky sheep pasture and showed them where arbutus
bloomed around the edges of the gray, mossy rocks.
And it was Sally, who pointed out to them the wintergreen,
or checkerberry, as she called it, with its tiny
pungent berries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s perfectly wonderful,&rdquo; Kit declared that day
at lunch. &ldquo;She knows the exact spot in this entire
township where every single flower bobs up in its
season. We found saxifrage at the base of an old oak,
and white trillium and bloodroot, and perfect fields of
bluets. And she wouldn&rsquo;t let us pick many either, only
a few. She says it&rsquo;s just as cruel to rob a patch of wild
flowers of all chance of blooming again next year as
it is to rob birds&rsquo; nests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Doris chimed in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s going to teach me how to start a flower
calendar. Not in a book, Mom. We&rsquo;re going to take
some of that monk&rsquo;s cloth and mount specimens on it,
then make a folio with leather covers of dyed sheepskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally seems to be a regular dynamo for starting activities,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Craig amusedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is just exactly that,&rdquo; Kit answered earnestly.
&ldquo;I never met a girl with so many ideas up her sleeve.
And they&rsquo;re as poor as churchmice. Sally told us so
herself. And here she is, cooped up in Elmhurst without
any outlet at all. She knows what she wants to do,
but we girls can tell her how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally&rsquo;s going to peddle our rhubarb for us,&rdquo; Kit
went on. &ldquo;I think that rhubarb is a most wonderful
plant. It seems to spring up everywhere and pay compound
interest on itself every year. I found a lot of it
growing and thought it was peonies or dahlias, but
Sally told me it was rhubarb, and we&rsquo;re going to market
it. She says there&rsquo;s a big cranberry bog on this place
too, away off in some sunken meadows above the dam,
and we must look out because somebody comes and
picks them without asking anything at all about it.
So we&rsquo;re going to watch the old wood road that turns
into the sunken meadows. We can see it, Mom, from
the window over the kitchen sink, and heaven help
anybody who takes our cranberries!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t start looking for him yet awhile, dear.
Cranberries won&rsquo;t be along until frost,&rdquo; laughed Mrs.
Craig.</p>
<p>Tommy, with Buzzy&rsquo;s help, was devoting himself to
the hens. Although they had come rather late, still
quite a few were setting, and Tommy had several almanacs
and calendars marked with the dates of the
&ldquo;coming offs,&rdquo; as Buzzy put it. Then there were about
twenty tiny balls of fluff in the brooder from Rebecca&rsquo;s
incubator, and over these Tommy fussed and wasted
more sentiment than any chickens deserved.</p>
<p>One of &ldquo;Ma&rdquo; Parmelee&rsquo;s pullets had turned out to
be a vagrant. Never would she stay with the rest of
the chickens in the hen house or yard, or even around
the barnyard. She was jet black and very peculiar. At
feeding time she would show up, but hover around
the outskirts of the flock and nibble at kernels of corn
anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Jean named her &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; in fun, because she said
she was always looking for &ldquo;rats in the arras.&rdquo; But her
real name was Gypsy. It was agreed that Gypsy had no
idea of her natural obligation to society at all, that she
didn&rsquo;t have the slightest intention of setting on any
eggs, in fact that she didn&rsquo;t even have the gratitude to
lay any eggs. All she did was appear promptly at mealtime
and eat her share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be Gypsy a la Reine one of these fine Sundays,&rdquo;
Kit prophesied darkly, but Tommy begged for
her life. In fact, whenever chicken was on the bill-of-fare
Tommy always begged off any of his flock from
execution, and Buzzy had to go to one of the neighboring
farms and buy one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so awful to eat a chicken that you&rsquo;re well-acquainted
with,&rdquo; Tommy explained. &ldquo;And another
thing, Mom, did you know that the boys set traps
around? Not now, but in the fall. At least, I think it&rsquo;s
in the fall. I had Buzzy paint me some signs on shingles
and I&rsquo;m going to put them all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they say, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say just this.&rdquo; Tommy&rsquo;s tone was full of firmness
and decision. &ldquo;<i>Any traps set on this property will
be sprung by</i> ME.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they state who &lsquo;Me&rsquo; is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I signed it with Dad&rsquo;s name, and put underneath
&lsquo;Per T.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The screen door slammed and Kit walked into the
living room from the porch. &ldquo;Good night, everybody,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;The night is yet young, but I&rsquo;ve
promised Buzzy&mdash;or rather, Buzzy and I have a bet
that I can&rsquo;t get up at five and help weed the garden.
And we bet my tennis racket against five of Buzzy&rsquo;s
records. Don&rsquo;t anyone call me, because it&rsquo;s got to be
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris and Tommy decided that they were sleepy
too, and the three went upstairs together, leaving Jean
and her mother to read in the big living room. Presently
Mrs. Craig glanced up and saw that the book lay
idle on Jean&rsquo;s lap, and she was looking down at the
wood fire that burned on the old fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean shook her head, and smiled. &ldquo;No, country life
doesn&rsquo;t tire me. I love it even though I am lonesome
for my old friends. I think I&rsquo;ll go over to Sally&rsquo;s tomorrow
and see if she&rsquo;ll take me to meet some of the young
people.&rdquo; Jean dangled her legs over the arm of the
chair and studied her scuffed saddle shoes. &ldquo;If they are
all as nice as Buzzy and Sally they must be swell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">12. The Craigs Plan a Barbecue</span></h2>
<p>Breakfast at Woodhow was supposed to be seven-thirty,
but the girls and Tommy got up at about six
and spent the hour before out in the garden. It was so
fascinating, Doris said, to be out-of-doors in the early
morning. Sometimes when the air was warmer than
the ground there would be a morning mist out of
which rose clumps of tree tops like little islands.</p>
<p>The following day, at five-thirty exactly, Jean
wakened drowsily to find Kit standing by her bed, already
dressed in blue jeans and a sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to look at this clock and be a witness
that I&rsquo;m up on time,&rdquo; she said briskly, holding up an
alarm clock. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly gorgeous outside, Jean. I
don&rsquo;t see how you can lie and sleep with all nature
calling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nature didn&rsquo;t call you before, did she, Kathleen?
Go away and let me sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I get the records anyway.&rdquo; She seated herself
blithely on the foot of the bed. Jean sat up and
hurled her pillow at her, but Kit dodged and ran,
laughing, down the hall.</p>
<p>After breakfast though, when the dew was gone
from the meadow grass, Jean had Buzzy saddle Princess,
the mare, and declared she was going to ride over
and get Sally to take her visiting. Kit and Tommy
were busy out in the kitchen garden, and Doris was
helping with the dusting. For some reason Jean
wanted to go without them on this first reconnoitering
expedition.</p>
<p>She rode down the hill toward Elmhurst, bowed
with a little rising flush of color to the group in the
front of the feed store, and stopped before the brown
and white house where the Hancocks lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Jean,&rdquo; called Sally buoyantly, beating some
oval-braided rugs out on the clothesline. &ldquo;Can you
stop in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Jean leaned forward, the reins held loosely in her
hand. &ldquo;I wanted to see if you couldn&rsquo;t go riding with
me. Just so I can meet some of the girls. We want to
give a barbecue or some sort of a party to get acquainted
with our neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the idea,&rdquo; Sally exclaimed, dropping her
stick and pushing back her hair. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s awfully
nice. Wait till I ask Mother if I can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean waited and presently Mrs. Hancock stepped
out on the side porch and down the steps. She was
rather like Buzzy and Sally, curly-haired and young-looking,
with deep dimples and eyes that still held an
abiding happiness in their blue depths. Her face was
careworn and there were lines around her mouth that
told of repressed pain, but it was the look in the eyes
that held you. Luella Trowbridge may have gone
through trouble, but she had married the man she
loved and had been happy with him. She stretched
out both hands to Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buzzy&rsquo;s told us so much about all of you up there
that it seems as if I know every single one of you,&rdquo; she
said pleasantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jean, aren&rsquo;t you? Of course
Sally can go along if she wants to. Don&rsquo;t forget the
new girl over at the old Parmelee place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Jean never forgot that morning. They rode miles
together, stopping at the different houses and meeting
the girls who were, to Jean at least, the material upon
which she had to work.</p>
<p>At the old Ames place they found the two Swedish
girls, tall, blonde, and blue-eyed, working out in the
onion patch with their brothers. Ingeborg was the
elder and Astrid the younger, sixteen and fourteen
years old. They had moved from New York two years
before, but had both gone to the public schools there
and were ready for anything Jean suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingeborg belonged to a basketball team,&rdquo; Astrid
said. &ldquo;I can swim and play tennis best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chapelles lived in a little gray house close to
the road on Huckleberry Hill, two miles below Rebecca&rsquo;s.
Etoile was shy-eyed and graceful, smiling but
non-committal, and little Tony peered around her
mother&rsquo;s skirts at the stranger on horseback and coquetted
mischievously. But they would come, and
gladly, Mrs. Chapelle promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like very much to come, you see?&rdquo; she said
eagerly, trying to detach Tony from her skirt. &ldquo;Tony,
I have shame for you, <i>ma petite</i>. Why don&rsquo;t you come
out and say hello? Etoile, go bring some lilacs, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Etoile sped away to the tall rows of white and purple
lilac bushes, and broke off two large bunches to
give to Jean and Sally. Then Mrs. Chapelle remembered
that she must send over to her new neighbor a
pat of her butter. Such beautiful butter never anyone
see, never. Jean must ride around through the lane
and see the three Jersey cows browsing there in the
clover field, Henriette, Desiree, and Susette.</p>
<p>Last of all came the Icelandic farm, and here Jean
found only the hired men, two grave-faced, light-haired
transplanted vikings, who eyed her curiously
and silently. Hedda, the daughter, and her mother
had driven over to sell two young pigs at the Finnish
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, golly,&rdquo; laughed Jean, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go home. I feel as
if I had been riding like Peer Gynt, all over the world,
just touching at countries here and there. Let&rsquo;s go
right straight home, so I can talk to Mother and get
a perspective on it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better ask the Mill girls over while you&rsquo;re about
it,&rdquo; Sally suggested, so they made one last stop at the
red sawmill in the valley below Woodhow. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
Americans. My friend lives here, Lucy Peckham.
She&rsquo;s got five sisters and three brothers, but Lucy&rsquo;s
the whole family herself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The three brothers worked in the sawmill after
school, and Jean didn&rsquo;t see them, but Lucy sufficed.
She came running out of the kitchen with a brown
and white checked apron covering her up, and her
red hair streaming behind her. She was short and
freckled and not one bit pretty, unless good health
and happiness and smiles made up for beauty. But the
instant you met Lucy you recognized executive ability
concentrated in human form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billy, keep out of those lettuce beds,&rdquo; she called to
a younger brother, strayed somehow from the mill.
&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Craig&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, call me Jean,&rdquo; Jean said quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re close
neighbors. If we didn&rsquo;t hear your whistle we&rsquo;d never
know what time it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been intending to get up the valley to
see you, but Mother hasn&rsquo;t been well, and all the girls
are younger than I, so I help around the house. We&rsquo;ve
got twins in our family, did Sally tell you? Sally and
I named them. We thought of everything under the
sun, Martha Washington and Betsey Ross, and Ruth
and Naomi, and Mercy and Faith, and then we got it
all at once. We&rsquo;ve had twins in our family before, Josephine
and Imogene, that&rsquo;s Mother and Aunt Jo, but
we didn&rsquo;t want to repeat. Somehow, it didn&rsquo;t show
any imagination.&rdquo; She laughed and so did Jean. &ldquo;So
we called ours Elva and Sylvia. We say Elvy and Sylvy
for short. Anne and Charlotte are twelve and nine and
the twins are only five. They&rsquo;re too cute for anything.
Wish you&rsquo;d all come down and see us Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucy&rsquo;d ask the whole world to supper Sunday afternoon,&rdquo;
Sally said as they finally turned up the home
road. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a dear, and she has to work all the
time. She never has a single day to herself, and she
doesn&rsquo;t mind it a bit. She does manage to get away
to sing in the choir Sunday mornings, but that&rsquo;s all.
And even if she isn&rsquo;t pretty, she&rsquo;s got a voice that
makes gooseflesh come out all over you, and you shut
your eyes and just tingle when it rises and falls. I think
she&rsquo;s wonderful. Isn&rsquo;t her hair red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coppery and it&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; Jean answered decidedly.
&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s swell. Why can&rsquo;t Anne and
Charlotte buckle down and help, so that Lucy can
get away once in a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother says she can&rsquo;t do without her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Jean pondered over that and finally decided it
was too deep for her to settle. It had been a very profitable
afternoon, and after she had taken Sally home,
she rode into the home drive, feeling as if she really
had a line on Elmhurst girls. Tommy came running
down to meet her as she jumped off, while Buzzy came
to take care of Princess. Tommy&rsquo;s eyes were shining
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeannie, what do you suppose has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s sprouted,&rdquo; Jean guessed laughingly.
Tommy spent most of his time watching to see if any
of the seeds had started to sprout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It isn&rsquo;t that. Gypsy&rsquo;s got little chickens. She
marched into the barnyard with ten of them, as proud
as anything. And nobody knows where she hatched
them at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean had to go immediately to see the new brood.
Gypsy had cuddled them around her in the barn on
a pile of hay and steadfastly refused to be removed.
If ever a hen looked nonchalant she did, quite as if
she would have said, &ldquo;I can do it just as well as any of
these ridiculous nesters that you&rsquo;re so proud of, and
my chicks are twice as perfect as theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wonderful babies, Gypsy,&rdquo; Jean told her.
&ldquo;Be careful of them now. Mothers have to behave
themselves, you know. No more gallivanting off to the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably will. I&rsquo;m going to put them into a
little coop tomorrow and her too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only proved, as Kit remarked, what children
would do for a flighty and light-minded person.</p>
<p>Jean changed into a dress and ran down into the
kitchen to help get lunch and tell her experiences of
the day, which proved so entertaining and comical
that Mrs. Craig finally came out and asked if they were
ever to have anything to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s tray is all ready, Mom,&rdquo; Jean replied, sitting
up on the kitchen stool beside the stove, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
just waiting for the biscuits to bake, and Kit&rsquo;s fixing
a beautiful jelly omelette. Mother, you never saw anything
so funny as these precious inhabitants, but
they&rsquo;re all gold, just the same, and I like them. And
we&rsquo;re going to have a barbecue.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">13. Swing Your Partner</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve forgotten to write Mr. McRae and tell him
how much we like the house,&rdquo; Doris said a few days
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know anything about the house, or
care either,&rdquo; protested Kit, struggling with some raspberry
bushes that needed disentangling and tying
back against the woodshed boards. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never even
seen it. Do you suppose he has the least bit of sentiment
for it the way we have or Sally has? I wouldn&rsquo;t
bother to write to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would,&rdquo; Doris answered serenely. She was
down on her knees hunting for four-leaf clovers. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t his fault that he&rsquo;s never seen the place. Maybe we
could coax him back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to coax him back. It must be our
one endeavor to keep him right out there in Saskatoon
forever. We must tell him the cellar&rsquo;s damp and
the roof leaks and the whole place has gone to rack
and ruin. If we don&rsquo;t he may come East and take it
away from us, and we want to save up and buy it and
give it back to Sally and her Mother and Buzzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Buzzy&rsquo;s real name?&rdquo; asked Tommy irrelevantly.
&ldquo;I never thought to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to study electrical engineering or else
be a rancher,&rdquo; Kit said. &ldquo;I never asked him what his
real name is. You&rsquo;re awfully inquisitive, Tommy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do all boys see in ranches, I wonder,&rdquo; put in
Doris. &ldquo;Back at the Cove, Dave Phelps always wanted
to be a cowboy and he&rsquo;s got to be a lawyer, his father
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll escape West some day and be whatever
he likes. I think one of the very worst things in
life is to have to be something you don&rsquo;t want to be.&rdquo;
Kit surveyed her work. &ldquo;Of course, in the ups and
downs and uncertainties, as Becky would remark, we
must be prepared for all things, but if you can decide
what you&rsquo;re best fitted for, then you ought to aim
everything at that mark. If Buzzy wants to be an electrical
engineer, he ought to get books now, and study
them hard, and if he wants to be a rancher, he ought
to go West&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>A voice came from midair apparently, overhead on
the woodshed roof which Buzzy was patching with
waterproof paint and tar. It was a mild and cheerful
voice and showed plainly that Buzzy was personally
interested in the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go West just now, Mom needs me. But I&rsquo;m
going as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three stared up at him with laughing faces.
&ldquo;Buzzy Hancock,&rdquo; exclaimed Tommy, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
you sing out to us before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted to hear what you had to say,&rdquo; said Buzzy
simply. &ldquo;Thought maybe I&rsquo;d get some good advice.
And my first name&rsquo;s Seth. Seth Guilford Trowbridge
Hancock. I&rsquo;m named for my grandfather. Sally called
me Buzzy when I was a little kid, so I suppose that I&rsquo;ll
be that all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally and Buzzy,&rdquo; repeated Doris musingly, &ldquo;when
you&rsquo;re really Sarah and Seth. Nicknames are queer,
aren&rsquo;t they? I think that babies should be called pet
names till they&rsquo;re old enough to choose their own.
Still Seth&rsquo;s a good name. It&rsquo;s a name to grow up to,
Buzzy. You ought to be stout and dignified, like Mr.
Pickwick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I don&rsquo;t know him, do I?&rdquo; asked Buzzy. &ldquo;Sally
wants to be something too, but girls can&rsquo;t do that. She
wants to be a builder and look after land. She wants
to go to the State Agricultural College too, and take
the forestry course. Do you know what she does? She
read some place that the chestnut trees were dying
out, so she takes a pocketful of sound chestnuts with
her whenever she goes out for a walk in the woods,
and every once in a while she sticks her finger in the
ground and plants a chestnut. What do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit drew in a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s wonderful. I don&rsquo;t see why she can&rsquo;t
go to the State College if she likes, or why she can&rsquo;t
take the forestry course. It isn&rsquo;t whether you&rsquo;re a boy
or a girl that matters in such things. It&rsquo;s just whether
you can do the work that counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can shut her eyes and walk through the woods
and tell the name of every tree just by feeling its
leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Jean appeared on the back porch and called down
to them to come up and wash for dinner. She stood
there in the doorway for a minute after the rest had
gone in, looking out at the fields highlighted by the
sun. As she stood there Buzzy came up, looking as if
there was something on his mind.</p>
<p>After a moment he said, &ldquo;Jean, there&rsquo;s going to be
a barn dance up at the Grange Saturday night. I wondered
if you&rsquo;d like to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? A barn dance? I&rsquo;ve never been to one. I&rsquo;d
love to. What are they like?&rdquo; said Jean all in one
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re a lot of fun. Everybody goes to them.
They do square dancing and sometimes they do regular
dancing besides. They have a caller, a man who
plays the fiddle and directs the dancing so you know
what steps to use. It&rsquo;s not hard to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a good time,&rdquo; said Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, then, I&rsquo;ll pick you up about eight. That be all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Swell, Buzzy. Gee, I&rsquo;d better go! Something&rsquo;s
burning.&rdquo; With that Jean turned and ran back into
the kitchen, feeling happier than she had since the
family had moved to Woodhow. When she told her
mother about it later, Mrs. Craig agreed that Buzzy
was very nice indeed to have offered to show her some
of the fun of living in the country.</p>
<p>Saturday night promptly at eight o&rsquo;clock, Buzzy appeared
at the front door with his hair slicked down,
his shoes polished, and looking quite different from
the boy who worked in the fields all day in overalls.
Jean opened the door for him, wearing a pretty light
blue cotton dress that set off her dark hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Buzzy. Come on in. I&rsquo;m all ready.&rdquo; She picked
up her bag, called good night to her family and they
went out.</p>
<p>It was a lovely spring evening, the smell of cherry
blossoms hung in the air and the moon was beginning
to come up over the hills. Buzzy opened the door of his
battered jalopy and Jean got in. Walking around to
the other side of the car, Buzzy broke off a sprig of
cherry blossoms and tossed them into Jean&rsquo;s lap. She
turned and smiled at him as she fastened the flowers
in her hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, you look nice tonight, Jeannie,&rdquo; he said, and
abruptly started the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Judging by the number of cars parked when they
arrived at the Grange, there were already a number of
people there before them. Inside they found quite a
crowd. A square dance had already begun, so Jean and
Buzzy stood watching the twirling mass of people
dance by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, they dance so fast. I&rsquo;ll never be able to do it,&rdquo;
exclaimed Jean. &ldquo;Does just that one fiddler play all
evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Sometimes somebody
plays the piano, too, or Jed Perkins brings his bass fiddle,
but usually just Nate plays. That&rsquo;s his name, Nate
White. Come on, let&rsquo;s try it. They&rsquo;re starting again.
Just follow me and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buzzy led her out onto the floor and they began to
dance. Much to her surprise, Jean found the steps
quite easy after she tried them a few times. It was far
more strenuous than it looked, however, and after a
couple of dances she was forced to sit down and catch
her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never danced so fast in all my life,&rdquo; she gasped
while they were resting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly thirsty. Do you
suppose they have anything cold to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Buzzy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute with
some of the best-tasting lemonade you ever drank.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>While he was gone, Sally appeared from out of the
crowd and came over to where Jean was sitting. &ldquo;Hi,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;How do you like night life, country style?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun,&rdquo; replied Jean, &ldquo;although it&rsquo;s a little exhausting.
But then, country living seems to be more
strenuous altogether than what I was used to.&rdquo; Just
then Buzzy came back with the lemonade and Sally
moved off with her partner.</p>
<p>After a few more dances, Jean declared she couldn&rsquo;t
take it any more, so the two left and drove back home.
At the door Jean said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank you enough for
the lovely time tonight, Buzzy. I never knew a barn
dance could be such fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try it again some night. Good night,
Jean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; And Jean went into the house and
upstairs to Kit, who was still awake and waiting impatiently
to hear the details of the dance. The two
older girls had always discussed their dates and parties
with each other back at the Cove, and the tradition
was not broken now. Together in Jean&rsquo;s room, they
talked it over while Jean undressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buzzy&rsquo;s tops, Jean,&rdquo; said Kit, after she had finished
describing the evening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;ll be the best
friend we make in this neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an evening I won&rsquo;t forget soon,&rdquo; replied Jean
sleepily. &ldquo;My feet ache so from dancing, I couldn&rsquo;t
possibly forget it for at least a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">14. Kit to the Rescue</span></h2>
<p>In the following days, the girls and Tommy turned
their attention to plans for the barbecue. The first
thing to be sure of was a full moon. This came along
the last week in June, so they made their arrangements
accordingly.</p>
<p>Buzzy and Sally took almost as much interest in the
affair as the girls themselves. All that day, when it
finally did arrive, they worked gathering wood for the
fire, knocking together temporary picnic tables, and
digging the barbecue pit at the back of the house.
Doris was making the lemonade and said she had cut
and squeezed lemons until her whole mouth was
puckered up, and her fingernails felt pickled. Kit was
everywhere at once, it seemed. She showed Buzzy how
to make the spit for the meat to be cooked on. She beguiled
Matt, who had come down from Maple Grove
to help around a bit, into moving the phonograph out
on the front porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>It did seem as if all Elmhurst and surrounding territory
had turned out to show its neighborly spirit.
There were cars parked along the road, in the barnyard,
the driveway, and everywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, Margie, if we had as many as
a hundred folks here tonight,&rdquo; remarked Becky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely two hundred, Rebecca. It looks like a
big crowd all right.&rdquo; They were up on the porch
where Mrs. Craig hovered between the lounge chair
where Mr. Craig sat, and her various guests, welcoming
each in her own charming way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>Doris and Kit followed Jean&rsquo;s lead. First Jean
rounded up the girls whom she had met on the ride
with Sally and introduced them to the other Craig
sisters. Tommy could not be located from one minute
to another. He raced all over the grounds. One minute
he was back by the barbecue pit trying to supervise
things but generally heckling Buzzy. The next minute
he was back in the front of the house dodging in and
out of the crowd. But Doris and Kit led the other girls
over to where the lemonade, ice cream and cake was
laid out and asked them to serve. It was much better
than standing around, shy and silent, not knowing
what to do next. Kit found one girl, Abby Tucker,
leaning disconsolately against a pear tree at the side
of the drive. Her white dress was too short for her, and
her hair was straggling in limp strands down her back.
She looked lonely and rather indignant too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to come over and help us with the
ice cream?&rdquo; asked Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Abby flatly. &ldquo;They always ask
me to help pass things to eat at the church suppers. I
want to have a good time myself tonight. Though we
aren&rsquo;t going to have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit looked at her doubtfully. She thoroughly realized
the state of mind that will not let itself be happy,
that in fact, finds its happiness in being unhappy, but
Abby&rsquo;s moroseness baffled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Abby nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know most of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; Kit laid her arm timidly around
the stooped shoulders and at the touch of real human
sympathy, Abby&rsquo;s reserve melted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My new shoes pinch awful,&rdquo; she exploded.</p>
<p>Kit took her straight up to the house to her own
room, and ransacked closets and shoe boxes until she
found a pair of loafers to fit Abby, and the latter came
down again smiling and radiant, ready to serve ice
cream, or make herself agreeable in any way she could.</p>
<p>Sally came up to the porch, personally conducting
her mother to Mrs. Craig. She was a tall, fair-haired
woman with deep dimples like the children&rsquo;s and a
happy face. Seated in a chair on the porch with the
roses and honeysuckle shedding a perfume around,
she breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems so nice to sit up here again, Mrs. Craig,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Sally&rsquo;s told me all about how you&rsquo;ve fixed
the place up till it seemed as if I couldn&rsquo;t wait to see
it. I used to drive over once in a while after Father
died, and get some slips of flowering quince and rose
bushes to set out. You know I love every blade of
grass in the garden and every pine cone on those
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you and the children couldn&rsquo;t have
had it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I never fret much over what
has to be. Maybe this boy Ralph is all right. He&rsquo;s my
nephew, but I&rsquo;ve never seen him. His father was a
claim settler out in Oregon first off, when Cousin
France married him. We called her that. Her name
was Francelia. Good stock, I guess. I wish Buzzy
could know him, he&rsquo;s so set on being a rancher. I
suppose settling and ranching&rsquo;s about the same
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig told her. Then came a
chat about her own father&rsquo;s ranch in California, and
when Sally came back after her mother, she found
her animated and interested over Buzzy&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Kit and Etoile were arranging a jam session for alternate
Saturday afternoons, the ones between to be
given up to tennis and basketball. Those who
couldn&rsquo;t dance would be taught by the others. Ingeborg
and Astrid and Hedda Hagerstrom stood listening
and agreeing with shining eyes and eager faces.
Hedda was short and strong-looking, with the bluest
eyes possible and heavy blonde braids. She stared at
Kit with wide-eyed wonder, Kit radiant and joyous in
a yellow chambray sun-back dress, with a sprig of
rambler roses in her hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come, won&rsquo;t you, Hedda?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And
bring any other girls over your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only Abby over my way. We live on the
same road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then bring Abby, but tell her to wear old shoes.
We ought to find enough girls to make up a good team
out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like hikes?&rdquo; asked Lucy Peckham. &ldquo;I think
it would be fun to have a hiking club, and each week
tramp away off somewhere. There&rsquo;s ever so many
places I want to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea, Lucy,&rdquo; Sally exclaimed.</p>
<p>The crowd began to break up and the Craigs stood
on the porch saying goodbye to everyone. It was after
twelve before the last car had driven away. Tommy
was found sound asleep in the living room on the
couch. Jean and Doris hunted in the grass for lost
spoons and ice cream saucers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good party,&rdquo; Jean said happily. &ldquo;We got
acquainted with all our neighbors, and now I feel as
if I could go ahead and organize something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">15. The Haunted House</span></h2>
<p>The following Saturday had been set as the first day
for the girls to meet at Woodhow. Lucy was the first
to arrive, as she lived nearest, and she brought with
her Anne and Charlotte.</p>
<p>Hedda and the two girls from the old Ames place,
Ingeborg and Astrid, arrived together and helped Kit
and Doris plan the tennis court. Below the terraces
the lawn lay smooth and even out to the south wall,
but it had been decided to sacrifice a slice of the hay
field across the road rather than the garden, and Matt
had ploughed up a good-sized oblong of land for them,
harrowed it smooth, and then the girls had pondered
over the problem of rolling it. It must be rolled flat,
wet down, and rolled again until it was fit to use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;We could fill a barrel with sand, and roll that,&rdquo;
Doris suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got something better than that,&rdquo; Buzzy said.
&ldquo;Over at Mr. Peckham&rsquo;s they&rsquo;ve got a road roller. Mr.
Peckham&rsquo;s the road committee in Elmhurst township&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit caught him up. &ldquo;The whole committee,
Buzzy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he enough? Ought to see him get out and
clean up with those boys of his. He&rsquo;ll let us take it, I&rsquo;m
sure, and it will roll that court down as smooth as can
be. I&rsquo;ll go after it this afternoon when I finish with the
potato patch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house being too far away from the site of the
tennis court, the girls had to fill buckets with water
from the brook and pour them over the harrowed
ground. It was hard work in the hot sun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half
dead,&rdquo; exclaimed Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, kid,&rdquo; Kit told her briskly. &ldquo;Think of
the result and what fun it&rsquo;ll be to play out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy stood back and looked at their work. &ldquo;What
else are you going to do up here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next we&rsquo;re going to start weekly hikes,&rdquo; Kit told
her. &ldquo;You girls have lived here for years, haven&rsquo;t
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just came up a while ago,&rdquo; Ingeborg corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, and so did Hedda, but Etoile and Tony
and Lucy and the rest of you all grew up right here,
didn&rsquo;t you? Well, then. What do you know about the
country for ten miles around?&rdquo; Kit paused dramatically.
&ldquo;Do you know every wood road and cow path
through the woods? Where does Little River rise?
Have any of you followed the rock ledge up into the
hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody but the hunters go there, and they don&rsquo;t
come till fall,&rdquo; said Hedda gravely. She hardly ever
smiled, this transplanted little daughter of far-off Iceland.
Her manner and expression always seemed to
the girls to hold a certain aloofness. Up at her home,
later on, they saw a finely carved model of a Viking
ship which her father had made back in the home
island, and Jean declared after that she always pictured
Hedda standing at its high prow, facing the gale
of the northern seas, her fair hair blowing behind her
like a golden pennant, her blue eyes fearless and eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll go. We&rsquo;ll pack a picnic lunch. Hey, kids,
are there any snakes up here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lots,&rdquo; said Lucy. &ldquo;But mostly black snakes.
They&rsquo;re ugly to look at, but they don&rsquo;t hurt you. And
little garter snakes, and green grass snakes. I never
think about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of anything out here, Lucy?&rdquo; Doris
asked interestedly. She had eyed Lucy admiringly
from the first moment of their acquaintance, and privately
Doris held many fears. It was all very well to
say there wasn&rsquo;t anything to worry over, as Kit did,
but one may step on toads in the dark, or hear noises
in the attic that make one shiver even if they turn out
to be just chipmunks after corn and nuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I know of,&rdquo; Lucy replied serenely.
&ldquo;I never felt afraid in the dark. Just as soon go all over
the house, upstairs and down, and when I go down
into the cellar, I yell &lsquo;look out, rats, here I come!&rsquo;
Guess the only thing I&rsquo;m really afraid of is a bat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s afraid of something,&rdquo; Etoile said, her
eyes wide with mystery. &ldquo;I have the fear too, oh, but
often. I am most afraid of those little mulberry
worms, you know them? They come right down at you
on little ropes they make all by themselves, and they
curl up in the air and then they drop on you. Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Kit rolled over on the grass in delight at this.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a riot,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;Tell some more,
Etoile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a haunted house on our road,&rdquo; Astrid
said in a lowered voice. &ldquo;The little spring house between
the old mill and our place. It&rsquo;s been there years
and years, my father says. He knows the old man at
the mill, and he told him. As far back as they can remember
it has always been haunted. First there lived
an old watchmaker there. He had clocks and watches
all over the house, and they ticked all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they kept him from being lonely,&rdquo; Doris
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very strange, and when he died, then two
old Indian women came to live there. And there was
a peddler used to go through and put up overnight
there, and he never was seen any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see the grave in the cellar where they
buried him,&rdquo; Ingeborg whispered. &ldquo;Right down at
the foot of the stairs. And at night he comes up and
goes all around the house, rattling chains. Yes, he does.
My brother went down with some of the boys and
stayed there just to find out and they heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over there on our hike and stay overnight,
kids,&rdquo; Kit exclaimed. &ldquo;I think it would be swell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe in ghosts, Kit?&rdquo; asked Lucy. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like to believe in them, but I just thought they
had to be believed in if they&rsquo;re really so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ll stay overnight at the spring
house, kids. It&rsquo;s a shame to have a real ghost around
and not make it welcome. If there are any ghosts,
which I doubt, they must be the lonesomest creatures
in all creation because nobody wants them around.
Suppose we say that next Friday we&rsquo;ll walk up to the
house and camp out for the night. Who&rsquo;s afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls looked at each other doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I bring our dog along?&rdquo; asked Ingeborg.
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m not afraid, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring anything you like. I&rsquo;m going to take a flashlight.
Here comes our roller, now. We&rsquo;d better finish
the tennis court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca told the story of the old spring house when
they saw her. She could remember Scotty McDougal,
the old watchmaker who had lived there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Land, yes, I should say I could. He used to wear an
old coonskin cap with the tail hanging down, and
carried an old gun along with him wherever he went.
After he died, two old women moved in from somewhere
in the woods toward Dayville. They were Indian,
I guess, or gypsy, real good-hearted people so
far as I could see. Used to weave carpet and rag rugs
and make baskets. There was a story around that they
could tell fortunes and see things in the future, but
that&rsquo;s just talk. I never pay any attention to such
things at all. Probably, if you could clear the house
of its name, somebody&rsquo;d be willing to live in it. It
belongs to Judge Ellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Judge Ellis?&rdquo; asked Kit, who always caught
at a new name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo; Becky laughed heartily. &ldquo;Meanest
man in seven counties, I guess. He ran for Senator
years ago and was beaten, and he took a solemn oath
he&rsquo;d never have anything to do with anybody in this
township again, and I guess he&rsquo;s kept it. He lives in
the biggest house here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All alone?&rdquo; asked Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All alone excepting for a housekeeper and his
grandson. He&rsquo;s just a fussy old miser, and the way he
lets that boy run wild makes my heart ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old a boy is he, Becky?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Craig,
feeling sympathetic at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should say about fifteen. Name&rsquo;s Billie. He&rsquo;s
a case, I tell you. What he can&rsquo;t think of in five
minutes isn&rsquo;t worth doing. Still, he&rsquo;s a good boy, too,
at that. Five of my cows strayed off from the pasture
lot last summer, and he found them after Matt had
run his legs off looking for them. And once we lost
some turkeys, and he found them over in the pines
roosting with the crows. He knows every foot of land
for ten miles around here and more, I guess. You
never know when he&rsquo;s going to bob out of the bushes
and grin at you. The Judge don&rsquo;t pay any more attention
to him than if he was a scarecrow. Seems that he
had one son, Finley Ellis, and he was that wild the
Judge turned him off years ago. And one day he got
a letter, so Mr. Ricketts told me, from New York, and
away he went, looking cross enough to chew tacks.
When he came back he had Billie with him, and that&rsquo;s
all Elmhurst ever found out. Billie says he&rsquo;s his grandfather,
and the Judge says nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him,&rdquo; Jean exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? The Judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Billie, this boy. What does he look like?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like all-get-out half the time, and never
comes to church at all. You&rsquo;ll know him by his whistling.
He can whistle like a bird. I&rsquo;ve heard him sometimes
in the early spring, and you couldn&rsquo;t tell his
whistle from a real whippoorwill. There is something
about him that everybody likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he comes over this way,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he will. The Judge never lets him have any
pocket money, so he&rsquo;s always trying to earn a little.
He&rsquo;ll come and try to sell you a tame crow, most likely,
or a trained caterpillar. I was driving over toward
their place one day and I declare if I didn&rsquo;t find him
lying flat in the middle of the road. Ella Lou barked
and I asked him what he was doing. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t drive in
the middle of the road, Miss Craig,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;&rsquo;cause
I&rsquo;ve got some ants here, taming them!&rsquo; Real good-looking
boy he is too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, but he sounds like fun,&rdquo; Kit remarked fervently.
&ldquo;I almost feel like hunting him up, don&rsquo;t you,
Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean nodded her head. She was putting up currants
and raspberries, and the day was very warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep a fire going in the house?&rdquo; Miss
Craig asked her. &ldquo;Put an old wood stove out in the
back yard, the way I do, and let it sizzle along. Goodbye,
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down and play tennis with us,&rdquo; called Doris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go &rsquo;long, child.&rdquo; Becky chuckled. &ldquo;How would I
look hopping around, slapping at those little balls!
Come on, Ella Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly,&rdquo; Kit exclaimed as the car drove away, &ldquo;it
seems as if every single day something new happens
here, and we thought it would be so dull we wouldn&rsquo;t
know what to do with ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Billie&rsquo;s something new?&rdquo; asked Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he sound interesting? I&rsquo;m going out to ask
Buzzy about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better help me finish these berries, Kathleen,&rdquo;
Jean urged. So Kit gave up the quest temporarily
and sat on the edge of the kitchen table, stripping
currants from their stems, and singing at the top
of her lungs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kit, do stop,&rdquo; begged Jean. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot to
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit looked out at the widespread view of Woodhow,
rich with uncut grass billowing with every vagrant
breeze like distant waves. It was hot in the
kitchen, hot and close. Suddenly Kit fled out the back
door and over to the pasture where Princess rambled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kit&rsquo;s fretful, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;She thinks she&rsquo;s getting into a rut,&rdquo; answered Jean.
&ldquo;We all do. Some days I get so homesick for the kids
back home and everything that we haven&rsquo;t got here&mdash;the
library and the art museum and the movies and
the symphony concerts. I think we ought to write
down and ask some of the girls to come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Not until Dad&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy was out of hearing. Jean looked over at
Doris, who in some ways always seemed nearer her
own age than Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris, honest and truly, do you think Dad&rsquo;s getting
any better?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>Doris hesitated, her face showing plainly how she
dreaded acknowledging even to herself the possibility
of his not improving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He eats better now, and he can sit up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he looks awful. I get goose pimples when I
look at him sometimes. His eyes look as if they were
gazing away off at some land we couldn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean Craig, how can you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, don&rsquo;t let Mother hear,&rdquo; cautioned Jean
anxiously. &ldquo;I had to tell somebody. I think of it all
the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t think of it. That&rsquo;s like sticking pins in
a wax statue back in the Middle Ages, and saying,
&lsquo;He&rsquo;s going to die, he&rsquo;s going to die,&rsquo; all the time. He&rsquo;s
getting better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean was silent. She felt worried, but if Doris refused
to listen to her, there was nobody left except
Becky. Somehow, at every emergency Becky seemed
to be the one hope these days, unfailing and unfearing.
Dauntless and cheerful, she rode over every obstacle.</p>
<p>But when Jean found an opportunity of speaking
to her of her father, Rebecca&rsquo;s face looked oddly
passive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, Jeannie,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Trust and obey, you know. There are lots worse
things than passing over Jordan, but we&rsquo;ve just got
that notion in our heads that we don&rsquo;t want to let any
of our beloved ones take the voyage. Tom&rsquo;s weak, I
know, and he ain&rsquo;t mending so fast as I&rsquo;d hoped for,
but he&rsquo;s gained. That&rsquo;s something. You&rsquo;ve been up
here only a couple of months. It took longer than that
to break him down, and it may take years of peace and
rest to build him up. Let&rsquo;s be patient. Dr. Gallup
seems to think he&rsquo;s got a good deal more than an even
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">16. Unexpected Visitor</span></h2>
<p>It would never do to leave Sally out of any hikes, Kit
said as the end of the week drew near again, and so
Buzzy was commissioned to give her a message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her we&rsquo;re going to walk from here over to
Mount Ponchas, and back by way of the Spring House.
We want to start at five Friday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought to start at daybreak for a hike,&rdquo; Buzzy replied.
&ldquo;Never heard of starting near sundown. You&rsquo;ll
fetch up by dark at the rock ridge and sleep in a deer
hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will,&rdquo; Kit responded hopefully. &ldquo;I
hadn&rsquo;t thought of that, Buzzy. It sounds awfully nice.
If you could just get a peep at our lunch you&rsquo;d want
to hike too, no matter where we fetched up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve camped out along the river. Not this river.
The big one down at the station, the Quinnebaug. We
fellas go down there when the bass is running and
fish for them nights. Eels too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know a boy named Billie Ellis?&rdquo; Kit asked
suddenly. &ldquo;Does he ever go along with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Billie Ellis? I should say not,&rdquo; Buzzy answered emphatically.
&ldquo;Judge Ellis wouldn&rsquo;t let him go along
anywhere with the rest of us fellows. He caught a big
white owl the other day over in the pines back of the
Ellis house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d come over our way some time. I&rsquo;d love
to know him. He sounds so kind of&mdash;well, different,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s different all right,&rdquo; laughed Buzzy good-naturedly.
&ldquo;I remember once three years ago it was
awfully cold, and we boys had been skating and went
into the feed store to get warm. And who should come
in but Billie Ellis without any hat on, and only an old
sweater and a pair of pants on, and shoes and socks.
We asked him how he ever kept warm such weather,
and what do you suppose he said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Kit&rsquo;s face was eager with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Said he had seven cats he kept specially to keep
him warm. Said the Judge wouldn&rsquo;t let him have any
fire, so he trained the cats to cuddle around him and
keep him warm. So long. I&rsquo;ll tell Sally you want her to
go along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit sat out on the terrace after he had passed up the
hill road. Jean and Doris were upstairs with their
father, and Tommy was out in the barn somewhere.
Her mother was playing the piano. Buzzy had been
gone about fifteen minutes when Kit heard the sound
of a car coming along the level valley road. It couldn&rsquo;t
be anyone for here, she thought. But just then the car
turned in at the wide drive entrance and came up to
the porch steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better wait,&rdquo; she heard a voice say, such
a nice voice, young and alive-sounding. Then somebody
bounded up the steps, three at a time, and
crossed the porch, with her sitting right there on the
top terrace below the rose and honeysuckle vines. Kit
always jumped to conclusions and now she decided
for some crazy reason that this was Ralph McRae,
from Saskatoon.</p>
<p>There was no doorbell or even a knocker, and the
double doors stood wide open, but the screen doors
were locked inside, so Kit stood up and called.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, please. I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for her, hat in hand and smiling. It was
shadowy, but she saw his face and liked it. He was
young and handsome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Miss Craig?&rdquo; he asked, and Kit flushed at
the tone. As if she didn&rsquo;t long seventeen hundred
times a month to be <i>the</i> Miss Craig like Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m only Kit,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re our Mr.
McRae, I think. Hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands with her and Kit led him around
to the side door and let him in while she lighted a
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s in here,&rdquo; she said, leading the way into
the living room. Mrs. Craig stopped playing and
looked up. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Kit said. &ldquo;Mr. McRae&rsquo;s come
from Saskatoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as if he&rsquo;d stepped over the whole distance in
about seven strides,&rdquo; Doris said later, after Mr. McRae
had been settled in the guest chamber, and the
family could discuss him safely. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s awfully
nice-looking, don&rsquo;t you, Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think about his looks, Doris,&rdquo; Jean replied
blushingly. &ldquo;All I can do is wonder what he has come
after. Does he want the house and farm? Or has his
conscience troubled him so much about Sally and her
mother and Buzzy that he&rsquo;s going to lay Woodhow on
their front doorstep in restitution? Or did he just want
to see what we all looked like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; suggested Kit blandly. &ldquo;He seems to be
a very approachable young man so far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wanted to go up to Rebecca&rsquo;s for the night and
Mother wouldn&rsquo;t let him. That shows that she likes
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Craig sat out in a big chair on the
porch with their guest, and seemed to enjoy his company
wonderfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe, Mom,&rdquo; Jean said, &ldquo;that poor Dad has
been smothered with too much coddling. Just look at
him brace up and talk to Mr. McRae.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we can persuade him to stay with us while
he is in Elmhurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t act as if he needed much persuading.
They&rsquo;ve discovered that they were both in the Army
and are comparing the Canadian Army with ours.
They&rsquo;ve already discussed salmon culture and
whether a soy bean crop will do well in Connecticut.
We girls think it&rsquo;s unfair of Dad to monopolize such
a charming guy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeannie, you&rsquo;d better come and help me put up
our lunch,&rdquo; called Doris from the kitchen. &ldquo;Bacon
and eggs are going to be the main course, with gingerbread
and fruit for dessert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been agreed that the girls should meet at
Woodhow that afternoon. Buzzy had been sent up to
Maple Grove with the news that Ralph McRae had
arrived, and an invitation for Rebecca to come down
for supper. She drove down about four, fresh and
cool-looking, wearing a black and white dress and a
wide-brimmed black straw hat. Ralph helped her out
of the car and stood smilingly while she examined him
closely and patted his shoulder as she expressed her
obvious approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the sort of boy I expected Francelia&rsquo;d have,&rdquo;
she said happily. &ldquo;Well built and handsome too. Going
to stay awhile, Ralph, and get acquainted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d like to, Miss Becky. It gets kind of lonesome
out West with none of my own people there. I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to come back here and see all of you.
Mother used to talk a lot about you all to me when I
was little. She didn&rsquo;t have anybody else to tell things
to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; Becky responded rather soberly.
&ldquo;You must meet your cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I had any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Craig glanced over to the woodpile where
Buzzy was sawing some chestnut tops for dry wood to
mix in with the birch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here, Buzzy,&rdquo; she called briskly. &ldquo;This
is the boy cousin and Sally&rsquo;s the girl, both children of
your mother&rsquo;s own sister Luella. Guess we&rsquo;ll get this
straightened out some time. Buzzy, this is Ralph McRae,
your own blood cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph took Buzzy&rsquo;s tanned, supple hand in his, and
held it fast, looking down at his cheery, freckled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re going to be pals, Buzzy,&rdquo; he said, and
Buzzy&rsquo;s heart warmed to him. Nobody had ever called
him that before.</p>
<p>When Sally arrived with the other girls, she too was
introduced, but she proved less pliable than Buzzy.
Straight and tall, she faced her new cousin, every
flash of her eyes telling him that she resented his
having all while they had nothing, and Ralph could
make no headway with her.</p>
<p>At five they were ready to start. Lucy could not go,
nor Anne, Charlotte, or Tony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>But the older girls were all there, and at the last
minute Abby Tucker came hurrying along the road
with a large paper bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought I&rsquo;d never get here, but I did,&rdquo; she said
triumphantly. &ldquo;I made popcorn balls for all of you.
And I&rsquo;ve got some red pepper too. Going to throw it at
the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you cold-blooded person,&rdquo; Kit exclaimed.
&ldquo;Red pepper at a poor harmless ghost! Shame on
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Abby only smiled mysteriously and gave the
girls to understand that red pepper was the very latest
weapon for vanquishing ghosts.</p>
<p>Jean had told each girl to bring a blanket. These
were spread down and rolled up army-fashion until
they looked like life buoys, then slung over the girls&rsquo;
shoulders. The commissary department consisted of
Kit, Hedda and Ingeborg, who counted over their
supplies. There were jam turnovers and deviled-egg
sandwiches, loaf cake and cheese, ham-on-rye sandwiches,
cherries, and gingerbread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re equipped for a journey over Chilkoot
Pass,&rdquo; Ralph told them teasingly. &ldquo;How many weeks
will you be gone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be home tomorrow about sundown,&rdquo; Kit retorted
haughtily. &ldquo;Should you see the distant light of
a signal fire you may come after us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean looked hopeful at this remark, almost as
though she wished it might happen. She suddenly
seemed reluctant to leave on this long-planned hike.</p>
<p>The girls left Woodhow and turned into the open
road. The first couple of miles went fast enough and
then Etoile glanced back over the shadowy road behind
them and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting a little dark.&rdquo; Even
though it was still broad daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a flashlight,&rdquo; Astrid said comfortably,
&ldquo;and Tip for sentinel. There isn&rsquo;t anything to be
afraid of that I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; retorted Kit. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t see
or hear something I&rsquo;m going to be awfully disappointed.
And if we do hear anything coming slowly
upstairs, don&rsquo;t flash the flashlight right at it until it
has a chance to show itself. I hope it will be a lovely
pale green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etoile stopped short in the middle of the road, her
eyes wide with dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps I&rsquo;d better go right back now,
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>But Kit and Ingeborg promised faithfully to guard
her if she would only stick the night out. They went
on up the long wood road, past the falls above the mill,
past Mud Hole where the boys fished for eels, past
Otter Island where Matt came to fish, and on to the
old spring house. It was set far back from the road in
a garden overgrown with weeds and tall timothy
grass, and tiger lilies grew rankly in green clumps
along the gray stone walls. The little wooden shelter
over the well was knocked over and the boards that
protected the windows had been pulled half off. Jean
went to the kitchen door and found it unlocked. Only
wasps and spiders were to be seen, and one stout old
toad that backed hurriedly out of sight under the
stone doorstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look it all over before it gets really dark,&rdquo; she
said, and they went in and out of each bare room, upstairs
and downstairs, into the old musty cellar, even
into the low-roofed loft over the summer kitchen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we know there&rsquo;s nothing here, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
Kit said, after the tour of inspection was over, and
they sat out on the grass near the well, with their food
spread around them. &ldquo;How perfectly wonderful
things taste after you&rsquo;ve walked, don&rsquo;t they? More ginger
cookies, please, Hedda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which room are we going to sleep in?&rdquo; asked
Abby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon sleep out here all night on
blankets, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Etoile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care if you want to,&rdquo; Doris agreed. &ldquo;Try
it on the little side porch. Then you can watch the
cellar entrance because the ghost may decide to come
up that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was getting quite dark by the time the supper
was cleared away. Candles were lighted and set on the
mantel in the front room and in the kitchen. Kit and
Hedda had returned from a successful foraging expedition
around the barn and corn house, and had
brought back armfuls of hay to spread under their
blankets on the floor. Tip, the brown water spaniel,
took the whole affair very seriously and made the circuit
of the grounds over and over again, chasing imaginary
intruders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girls, I guess we&rsquo;re all ready to go to bed,
aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; Kit called finally. They agreed and went
into the big living room where the fireplace was. The
nights were still very cool up in the hills, so Hedda
and Doris had been appointed wood-gatherers and a
fine dry wood fire blazed on the stone hearth. After
they were ready for the night, they sat around this in
a semicircle, eating popcorn balls and telling stories,
until all at once there came a sound that silenced
everyone and left them wide-eyed and scared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">17. A Ghost Is Uncovered</span></h2>
<p>It was unlike any sound the girls had ever heard back
at the Cove, almost like a human being in distress and
yet like some animal cry too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fox,&rdquo; whispered Astrid, getting nearer to her
big sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Abby. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a deer. They always
yell like that when there&rsquo;s a full moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right near, I think, right outside.&rdquo; Kit sat
up, eager and tense. &ldquo;Shall I flash the light, Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Wait until it comes again. I think it was
only some night bird.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>So they waited breathlessly. Every tiny creaking
noise in the old house was intensified by the heavy
silence. Jean rose and went to the window. The moon
was not up yet, and it was hard to distinguish objects,
but down in the garden she thought she saw something
that looked like a cow lying down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell just what it is. It may be only a stray
cow or horse,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw something at it,&rdquo; suggested Kit hopefully.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all throw something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to see whether it jumps or not,&rdquo; Astrid assented.
She hunted around and found some loose half
bricks in the chimney place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tip? He hasn&rsquo;t barked once,&rdquo; remarked
Abby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs are always frightened when they see ghosts.
Let me fire away at it first.&rdquo; Astrid took aim and the
half brick flew down at the dark thing with a deadly
thud, but there was no stampede. She leaned far out
the window, staring at it anxiously. &ldquo;It seems to me I
can see it move and it has horns and a sort of woolly
tail, kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a yak,&rdquo; Kit chuckled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to
do this much. I&rsquo;ll go to the door and open it, and you
girls stay here with bricks to throw, and when I
flash the light on it, if it jumps you can save me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>But before she could carry out the plan the sound
came again, longer and more thrillingly penetrating
than before. It was a wail and a challenge and a moan
all in one, not just one cry, but a prolonged succession
of them. As soon as it stopped Sally exclaimed,
&ldquo;Now I know. That&rsquo;s an owl and it comes from the
little attic over the ell where we couldn&rsquo;t climb because
there weren&rsquo;t any stairs. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Sally?&rdquo; Etoile&rsquo;s tone was almost trembling.
&ldquo;Never have I heard such a cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have. It&rsquo;s an owl, I know it is, one of those
big ones. Riding through the woods at night coming
home from town I&rsquo;ve been half scared to death by
one of them. Sounds like seventeen ghosts all rolled
into one. Come along, Kit, you and I&rsquo;ll go hunt it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest followed gingerly, a strange procession
bearing candles, Kit leading with the flashlight. Tip
stumbled up drowsily from the kitchen and barked
at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s all very well for you to bark now,&rdquo;
laughed Jean. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go after that noise?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>They reached the ell room and found a trapdoor
in the ceiling. Abby remembered seeing a ladder out
in the back entry behind the door, and this was
brought in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see this, kids,&rdquo; she exclaimed, running her
finger over it. &ldquo;No dust on the rounds. That shows it&rsquo;s
been used lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we the smart ones? Abby, I love the way you
never miss anything.&rdquo; Kit leaned the ladder up against
the wall and mounted it, with Sally close behind and
the other girls at its base. &ldquo;What if it shouldn&rsquo;t be an
owl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped with her palm against the trapdoor.
Raising it about an inch she flashed the light, and
there was a great fluttering overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; Sally cried excitedly. &ldquo;Do it
again, Kit. It can&rsquo;t hurt you and the light blinds it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>So the trapdoor was lifted again with the light of
the flashlight turned on full, and Kit cautiously pulled
herself up into the opening. It was tent-shaped and
low, not more than four feet at its highest. But instead
of being bare like the rest of the old house, there were
certainly evidences that someone had been there.
There was a tin can filled with fresh water, and a
strip of rag carpet laid down on the floor. A box of
fish hooks and neatly rolled lines lay on one side, and
there was a small frying pan and a knife and fork.
Rolled up in one corner was a pair of old overalls, and
some books much the worse for wear lay beside them.
Kit&rsquo;s glance took in everything, and last of all, backed
into a corner and blinking hard, was the ghost itself&mdash;a
big white owl.</p>
<p>Sally pulled herself up too, and reached out after
the books gently so as not to frighten the owl any
more. With a couple in her hand, they lowered the
door again, and joined the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an owl and a hermit&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; Kit told them excitedly.
&ldquo;Open the books, Sally, is there any name inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally read off the titles, &ldquo;<i>Treasure Island</i> and <i>David
Copperfield</i>! He&rsquo;s got a nice collection, hasn&rsquo;t he, whoever
he is? There isn&rsquo;t any name inside, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was certainly fresh water in that tin,&rdquo;
Kit said positively, &ldquo;and that shows the haunted house
is inhabited by something tangible, I mean something
besides the owl. Let&rsquo;s go to bed very calmly and sleep.
I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve laid the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Evidently they had, for the rest of the night was
peaceful and safe except for the owl crying out lonesomely
at intervals until about four o&rsquo;clock, when the
dawn came. Rolled in their blankets, the girls slept
soundly until the sunlight threw broad golden beams
into their quarters.</p>
<p>There was no rope on the windlass at the well, so
Ingeborg proposed that they go down to the river and
wash there. It was lots of fun. They found that the
dark and fearsome object they had heaved bricks at
the night before was only a big gray rock half sunken
in the ground.</p>
<p>Along the river margin turtles sunned themselves
in rows on the half-submerged logs, and a muskrat
scuttled clumsily for cover at sight of the invaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could go right in,&rdquo; said Jean, looking up
and down the winding course of the river as she parted
the alders, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t really safe when you don&rsquo;t
know the water. This looks full of unexpected holes
and snags. Where does it run to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down past the two mills, and rises away up in the
Quinnebaug Hills,&rdquo; Sally told her, kneeling on a flat
rock and splashing herself well. &ldquo;Did you see that
black snake slither out of the way then? They&rsquo;re awful
cowards. Yes, Jean, this comes from Judge Ellis&rsquo; place
about two miles beyond here, three and a half by
road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Judge Ellis? Billie&rsquo;s grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk just as if you knew him already, Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I feel as if I do, after all Rebecca has told us
about him. And when I do meet him, I&rsquo;m going to
make him my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? The Judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. This Billie person. Or I&rsquo;ll take him home to
Tommy&mdash;Tommy would be crazy about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Look what I found,&rdquo; Kit called out. &ldquo;Here
are some fishing poles hidden in the bushes. Know
what? There must be some boys around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once upstream they heard somebody whistling.
At first it sounded almost like a bird trilling
high and clear, but then it suddenly changed to
boogie-woogie. The girls sat there on the bank, sheltered
from view by the alders, and waited until a flat-bottomed
rowboat came into view. Standing at the
stern, one bare foot on the back seat and one on the
cross seat, with a long punting pole in his hands, was
a boy of about fifteen. He looked exactly like Huckleberry
Finn, his head protected from the sun by a limp
straw hat and his tattered overalls rolled above his
knees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>Whistling recklessly, sure of himself and the solitude,
he came down the river and guided the boat to
shore near where the girls sat scrutinizing him. He
hauled it up halfway out of the water, dropped the
pole into it, and started up the bank before he caught
sight of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Billie Ellis,&rdquo; Sally said quickly and waved
her hand to him. &ldquo;Hi, Billie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,&rdquo; Billie returned. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the blue,&rdquo; Doris spoke up merrily. &ldquo;Got
some fish for breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie hesitated, trying to appear nonchalant, but
plainly very much rattled by these girls who had invaded
his domain. He rolled down his overalls very
slowly and deliberately to gain time, and this gave the
others, particularly Doris, a chance to see just what
he looked like. He was quite tall, with crew-cut hair
of a rather nondescript color, and big brown eyes that
were startlingly frank and uncompromising. He was
tanned a nice healthy brown, and his smile was eagerly
friendly. Altogether, the Craigs approved of Billie at
sight. To the others he was more or less familiar, even
though none of them knew him well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where you all going?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just walking over the country,&rdquo; Abby told him.
&ldquo;Where are you going, Billie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie flushed at this direct question. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; he answered lamely. &ldquo;I come down the
river a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fed the owl,&rdquo; Doris said innocently. &ldquo;Just
some bread and ham. I suppose it thought it was a
new kind of mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie glared at her with quick indignation. They
had not been satisfied with finding out his landing
place and swimming hole. They had gone into the old
house and discovered his secret den and the big white
owl. He had always regarded girls as semi-dangerous,
but this was worse than even he had expected. He
turned to Sally as the one in the crowd that he knew
best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you go into the house for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To stay the night,&rdquo; Sally answered promptly.
&ldquo;The door was open and we went in. If people don&rsquo;t
want company they should keep their doors locked.
Anyhow, nobody lives here and we didn&rsquo;t hurt anything.
We wanted to see the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Billie grinned at this admission, a quick mischievous
grin that made his whole face light up and seem
to sparkle with fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come up and rattle his chains for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t, and I&rsquo;ll bet he never did for anybody
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Billie agreed blandly. &ldquo;How far up
the river are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mount Ponchas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only seven and a half miles. You can go
along up the hill road from here, and when you come
to the state road that has telegraph poles on it, you
turn off and go west. It&rsquo;s three hills over and you pass
through one village, Shiloh Valley. When you come to
Ponchas don&rsquo;t forget to look for the grave of the Cavalier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Doris. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard of
it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was touching Billie&rsquo;s heart in the right spot.
He knew every acre of land for miles around Elmhurst
and was especially interested in its historic lore.
The girls did not know it then, but life was quite dull
over at the Judge&rsquo;s place. There were only the Judge;
Mrs. Gorham, his housekeeper; Farley Riggs, his general
business man; and Ben Brooks, the hired man.
They were an unsympathetic household for a boy of
fifteen, especially one who had been unwelcome; but
he had made friends with Ben and had found him a
treasure house of information.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>There might be other sections of importance in the
United States besides Elmhurst, Connecticut, but Ben
held them in slight esteem. He had been born and
brought up there and had never even wanted to go
away. He was about forty when Billie first came,
genial, optimistic, rather good-looking, and an insatiable
reader.</p>
<p>Next to roaming over the country, Billie liked best
to sit up in Ben&rsquo;s room, looking at his books and magazines
and listening to him talk on current topics and
historic events. No subject was too intricate for Ben
to tackle. No government ever evaded him when it
came to diplomatic tricks or ways. He was on to them
all, he told Billie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>It had been Ben who had first told Billie about the
mysterious stranger who had come to Elmhurst back
in the pioneer days. The colonists had suffered much
from Indian raids until there came into their midst a
man whom they called the Cavalier. With his Negro
servant, he had lived among them and taught them
defense against their savage enemies, taught them the
best way to win over the soil and reclaim the wilderness.
Yet when he died they knew no more of him than
on the first day when he rode into their village. His
grave lay over on the south side of Mount Ponchas
where he had wished it to be, near a rock where he had
often held council with the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to see it when you get there,&rdquo; Billie advised.
&ldquo;I wish I was going along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over to our place, won&rsquo;t you, Billie?&rdquo; Doris
asked in her most neighborly way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask you
about some arrowheads we found. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie nodded his head nonchalantly. It was like
giving a bird an invitation to call on you, or handing
your card to a rabbit. But he watched them as they
went up the hill road from the river, and when Doris
turned and waved, he waved back. At least he was interested
in his trespassers, even though he could not
quite forgive them for having discovered his pet hiding
place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">18. Kit and Buzzy Devise</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">a Scheme</span></h2>
<p>It was noon before they reached Ponchas, although
they might have gone ever so much faster if every new
flower by the way had not coaxed them to linger. They
camped at the base to eat their lunch and then Kit and
Ingeborg went hunting the Cavalier&rsquo;s grave. It was
Hedda who found it when she brought water from the
spring house that had been built over a live spring
gushing out at the base of the rock. Near by was a heap
of gray moss-covered rock piled into a cairn, with a
rugged rock cross at the head. On it were cut out the
words:</p>
<p class="center">He succored us
<br />The Cavalier
<br />1679</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do think they might have told us more than
that,&rdquo; Jean said, when the others came to look at it.
&ldquo;Perhaps, though, this would have pleased him better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood for a few moments gazing at the quiet
resting place, wondering what the Cavalier&rsquo;s real
story was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think his servant could have told us if he had
wanted to,&rdquo; Etoile said wisely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask my dad about
him. He knows many of the old stories of the places
around here. He came here from Canada when he was
a very little boy. There were wolves around in the
wintertime, and the spring came earlier then. He has
found arbutus as early as the first week in March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they started back they sang along the road,
first the songs that all of them knew, and then Hedda
sang two strange Icelandic songs her mother had
taught her, lullabies with a low minor strain running
through them. She had a strong, sweet voice, and sang
with much feeling.</p>
<p>After hearing the other girls Jean said they ought
to have a glee club, even if they met only once a
month.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just for music. Mom told me that music is the universal
language that everyone understands. Let&rsquo;s meet
at our house next week, and we can start learning the
folk songs of other countries. Etoile can teach us
French songs, Ingeborg and Astrid the Swedish ones,
and Hedda the songs of Iceland. We could learn a
great deal that way and enjoy ourselves at the same
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to meet somewhere else, not all
the time at your house, Jean,&rdquo; Etoile demurred in her
courteous French way. &ldquo;We would love to have you
come any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will come, won&rsquo;t we, girls?&rdquo; Jean said.
&ldquo;And Lucy will enjoy that because she can sing too,
and it will be near home for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next few weeks were filled with home activities
and it was hard to squeeze in time for all that they
had outlined. There were berries to can and preserve,
and Ralph McRae prolonged his stay, but only on
one condition&mdash;that he be allowed to take hold of the
farm, with Buzzy&rsquo;s help, and manage the haying and
cultivating for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea a man could be so handy,&rdquo; Jean declared.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mended the sink, and he&rsquo;s burned up the
rubbish at the end of the lane, and he put new roofing
on the hen houses, and he even climbed into the big
elm and put up Doris&rsquo; swing for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit smiled to herself at this, for secretly she thought
Ralph McRae was just right for Jean. And she, too,
liked him enormously, he was like the big brother
she&rsquo;d always wanted. She resolved to talk it over with
Buzzy, who had become her fast friend, and see if together
they could work out some scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very capable,&rdquo; Kit agreed. &ldquo;I think by the
time he goes we will have everything on the place
mended and repaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good doctor too,&rdquo; replied Jean. &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s been
so much better since he came. I wish when he goes
back to Saskatoon that he&rsquo;d take Buzzy with him. He&rsquo;s
got his heart set on going West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Kit, &ldquo;it would be wonderful for
Buzzy. Not having a father he should have the companionship
of an older man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;an older man&rsquo;?&rdquo; said Jean indignantly.
&ldquo;To listen to you, a person would think
Ralph was a decrepit old man of thirty-five. He&rsquo;s only
twenty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know how old he is? Did you ask
him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Becky told me. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s old at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took three days to cut the hay, even with the girls
and Tommy helping Buzzy and Ralph. One morning
when Buzzy and Kit were working together apart
from the others, Kit saw her opportunity to discuss
her plan for Jean. Buzzy regarded the idea disdainfully
at first, but Kit seemed so anxious he rather half-heartedly
agreed to do what he could.</p>
<p>Buzzy had a brilliant if indefinite plan to offer.
&ldquo;Look, Kit,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost certain that Mom
will let me go back to Saskatoon with Ralph. We&rsquo;ve
talked it over and Mother knows how much I want to
learn about ranching. Maybe when we get out there,
you and Jean could come out and visit us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wel-l,&rdquo; Kit said dubiously, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s an awfully long
way and the trip would cost too much. Besides, he&rsquo;s
here now. Can&rsquo;t you think of something that would
get results right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, what are you trying to do, marry her off or
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, silly. What would I want to do that
for? I&rsquo;m going to miss you, Buzzy,&rdquo; she added irrelevantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be leaving until the end of July, so don&rsquo;t
get mournful, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later that day, Kit&rsquo;s confidence in Buzzy was restored,
when he came up with a pail of spring water
and remarked to Jean, &ldquo;Say, if you go down where
Ralph&rsquo;s cutting now, you&rsquo;ll see a bobwhite&rsquo;s nest and
speckled eggs. Don&rsquo;t take any, though.&rdquo; And Jean ran
off to inspect the nest. &ldquo;Is that what you meant, Kit?&rdquo;
he said, after Jean had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting the idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph was almost finished cutting the hay when
Jean ran up. &ldquo;Buzzy said you found a bird&rsquo;s nest over
here. I came to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s over this way. Come on, I&rsquo;ll show it to you,&rdquo;
Ralph said, taking her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Jean, when he had pointed out the nest
with the three speckled eggs, &ldquo;the country holds so
many surprises. Where I used to live we never saw
things like this, except in the educational movies they
showed us at school. Even in the short time we&rsquo;ve lived
here, I&rsquo;ve learned so much about the outdoors. Why,
now I can name the birds I hear singing in the woods
and recognize the wildflower plants even when they&rsquo;re
not in bloom. It&rsquo;s really amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Ralph, looking down at her and
smiling. &ldquo;Even I have learned a good deal during my
visit. It&rsquo;s much different from the prairies that I&rsquo;m
used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Jean, returning his gaze. &ldquo;Tell me
what the country out there is like. You haven&rsquo;t said
much about it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Ralph began telling her of his work on the ranch.
&ldquo;I wish you could see it, Jeannie, it&rsquo;s really beautiful,
those rolling prairies and the cattle roaming over the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly time for supper, so the two walked
back to the house together, leaving the others to bring
in the wagonload of hay. Ralph went on to talk of
other things and by the time they reached the house,
Jean felt as though she had known him a long, long
time instead of only a few short weeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">19. Rebecca&rsquo;s Romance</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, Ella Lou. No use in chasing rabbits
when you never catch any of them,&rdquo; came Becky&rsquo;s
voice from the driveway. &ldquo;Anybody home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kit sprang out of the porch swing and Doris
emerged from the vegetable garden as if by magic.
Billie Ellis sat beside Becky as big as life, as she
would have said, and looked amiably at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Judge is very sick,&rdquo; Miss Craig began abruptly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down there with Billie, and I
may have to stay overnight. He&rsquo;s pretty low, I understand,
and wants me, so I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to go. Goodbye.
If you&rsquo;ve got any tansy in the garden, Margie, I&rsquo;d
like to take it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean hurried to get a bunch of the herbs, and Mrs.
Craig walked out to the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is he very sick, really, Becky?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell a thing about it till I see him, and then
maybe not. A man&rsquo;s a plague at best and when he&rsquo;s
sick he&rsquo;s worse. I suppose it&rsquo;s acute indigestion. Dick
Ellis always did think he could eat anything he
wanted to and do anything he wanted to, and the
Lord would grant him a special dispensation to get
away with it because he was Dick Ellis. I guess from
all accounts he hasn&rsquo;t changed much. I&rsquo;ll get a good
hot mustard plaster outside, and calomel and castor
oil inside, and tansy tea to quiet him, and I guess
he&rsquo;ll live awhile yet. Get back in the car, Ella Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things,&rdquo; said Mrs. Craig, as the car
backed out of the drive. &ldquo;And they haven&rsquo;t spoken
to each other in over thirty years. I think that&rsquo;s the
best thing that&rsquo;s happened since we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Mom?&rdquo; asked Jean. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know that Rebecca knew the Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were engaged years ago, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Craig
explained. &ldquo;They quarreled a few days before they
were to have been married, and Rebecca broke the
engagement. They never spoke to each other afterwards.
She wanted to go up to Boston on her wedding
trip and on to Concord from there, and the
Judge wanted to go to New York, as he had some
business to settle there and he thought he could attend
to it on the honeymoon trip. Rebecca said if he
couldn&rsquo;t take time away from his business long
enough to be married, she wouldn&rsquo;t bother him to
marry her at all. Even now it&rsquo;s rather hard deciding
which one was right. Now he thinks he is dying and
has sent for her. And I suppose, underneath all her
odd ways, that she still loves him after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were quite intrigued with the story of
Becky&rsquo;s romance and waited eagerly for the sound of
her car turning into the driveway on the return trip.
But night came on and passed, and it was well into the
next afternoon before Billie drove in alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;d like to have Mr. Craig come down
and draw up his will. Becky says he&rsquo;s been a lawyer,
and there isn&rsquo;t another one anywhere near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Billie, he isn&rsquo;t strong enough,&rdquo; began Mrs.
Craig. She was sitting out on the porch, a basket of
mending on her lap, and in the lounge chair beside
her was Mr. Craig. &ldquo;Is the Judge worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, no, he&rsquo;s better. Aunt Becky fixed him right
up. He&rsquo;d just eaten too much, she said.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d like to go, dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Craig. &ldquo;You
or Jean could come along, and I&rsquo;d like to meet him
again. I knew him when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his first trip away from the house since they
had moved there, but now that the time had come, it
seemed an easy thing to do, as if the strength had been
granted to him to meet just such a crisis. Mrs. Craig
accompanied him, and they drove over through the
village and up two miles beyond until they came to
the Judge&rsquo;s home, a large square colonial house on a
hill, surrounded by tall elms and rock maples. The
green blinds were all carefully closed except those
in the south chamber where Becky held supreme
sway now. She sat by his bedside, spick and span in a
dress of green linen. There was a bunch of dahlias on
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in, boy,&rdquo; the Judge said in his deep
voice. He stretched out his hand to Mr. Craig and
nodded his head. There was a look in his eyes that told
of an indomitable will, but they softened when they
rested on his visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, lad. No, the easy chair. Becky, give him
the easy one. So. Well, they try their best to get us,
don&rsquo;t they? I thought last night would be my last.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; laughed Miss Craig. &ldquo;Just ate too
much, and had a little attack of indigestion, Dick.
You&rsquo;ll live to be eighty-nine and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he gazed at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still contrary as can be, Becky. Won&rsquo;t even let me
have the satisfaction of thinking you saved my life,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good dose of peppermint and soda would have
done just as well,&rdquo; answered Becky serenely, turning
to introduce Mrs. Craig. &ldquo;He says he wants to make
his will, but I think it&rsquo;s only a notion, and he wants
company. Still I guess we&rsquo;ll humor him. It seems that
he was going to leave everything he had to me. And I
just found him out in time. The very idea when he&rsquo;s
got Billie, his own grandchild, flesh and blood, and
such a charming boy too. He can leave me Billie if he
likes, but he can&rsquo;t leave me anything else. So you make
it that way, Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave her Billie, Tom,&rdquo; sighed the Judge, &ldquo;leave
her Billie, and me too, if she&rsquo;ll take us both.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have you for a gift, Dick,&rdquo; she answered,
cheerful and happy as a girl as she looked down at
him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fussy, spoiled, selfish old man, just as
you always were, and I couldn&rsquo;t be bothered with you.
But I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on you so you don&rsquo;t kill yourself
before your time with sweet corn and peach shortcake,
though I suppose it&rsquo;s a pleasant sort of taking off at
that. I&rsquo;ll take Billie and Margie around the garden
while you and Tom fix up that will, and mind you do
it right. Billie&rsquo;s going to have all that belongs to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the door closed behind her, the Judge winked
solemnly at Mr. Craig. &ldquo;Finest woman in seven
counties. Ought to have been the mother of heroes
and statesmen, but there she is, mothering Billie and
bossing me to her heart&rsquo;s content. Do you think she&rsquo;d
marry me, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Judge,&rdquo; Mr. Craig replied. &ldquo;Becky&rsquo;s
odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe so. Go ahead and make the will as
she says. Everything to Billie, and make her guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the will was drawn up and Mrs. Gorham, the
housekeeper, and Mrs. Craig witnessed it. Billie,
standing down in the garden with Miss Craig, did not
realize what was happening. He only knew that somehow
the barriers of ice were lifted between himself
and his grandfather, and that a new era had dawned
for all of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>He watched the Craigs drive away, and went back
upstairs to the long corridor. Becky heard his step and
opened the door of the sickroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here, Billie,&rdquo; she said. It was the first time
that Billie had ever been in his grandfather&rsquo;s room.
He stood inside the door, a sturdy figure, barefooted
and tanned, with eyes oddly like those that surveyed
him from the pillow. He hesitated a moment, but the
Judge put out his hand, a strong bony one, and Billie
gripped it in his broad one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad you&rsquo;re better, Grandfather,&rdquo; he
said, a bit shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I, Billie, last night I thought my hour had
come, but I guess it was only a warning. A meeting
with the Button Molder perhaps. Do you know about
him? No? You must read &lsquo;Peer Gynt.&rsquo; A boy of your
age should be well read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when has he had any chance to get well read,
I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo; demanded Rebecca, in swift defense
of her favorite. &ldquo;The boy finished the district
school a year ago. Been learning everything he knows
since then from Ben, your hired help. If the Lord has
spared you for any purpose, Dick, it is to bring up
Billie right and teach him all you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, quit scolding me, Becky. Do as you
like with him. I&rsquo;ll supply the money.&rdquo; The Judge
pressed Billie&rsquo;s hand almost with affection. &ldquo;What do
you want to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lawyer or a naturalist,&rdquo; was Billie&rsquo;s prompt
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be both. They&rsquo;re good antidotes for each other.
Talk it over with him, Becky, and do as you think
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, and Billie took it as a signal to
leave the room, but the Judge spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you sleep, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie colored at this. It was the first time anyone
had ever called him Bill and he felt two feet taller all
at once. &ldquo;In the little bedroom over the east ell, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change your belongings to the room next to this.
It faces the south and has two bookcases filled with my
books that I had at college. You will enjoy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie went out softly, down the circular staircase
to the lower hall and, once outdoors, on a dead run for
the barn. Ben was husking corn on the barn floor, sitting
on a milking stool with the corn rising around
him in billows, whistling and singing alternately.</p>
<p>Billie poured out his news breathlessly, and Ben
took it all calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad for you. I always believed the Judge
would come out of his trance some day and do the
proper thing. That Miss Becky&rsquo;s a sightly woman.
Knows just how to take hold. Guess she could marry
the Judge tomorrow if she wanted to. Mrs. Craig is a
fine woman too. I&rsquo;ve never seen her before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow this didn&rsquo;t seem to fit in with Billie&rsquo;s
mood and he left the barn. All the world looked different
to him. He was wanted, really wanted, now.
He wasn&rsquo;t just somebody the Judge had taken in because
they were related and he had to out of pride. He
was to have the big south chamber right next to the
Judge&rsquo;s own room and study all he wanted. Best of
all, since he had grasped that bony hand in his, he
knew that he could go to him with anything and that
he really was going to be a grandfather to him.</p>
<p>It was nearly two miles over to Woodhow if he went
cross lots, but he started. When he arrived he found
Doris stoning cherries for pies. &ldquo;Hi, Billie,&rdquo; she called.
&ldquo;Come over here and help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie climbed the stone wall and came, flushed and
triumphant. Throwing himself down on the grass beside
Doris, he told what had happened, and she made
up for all that Ben had lacked in enthusiasm and imagination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful?&rdquo; she cried, setting down the
pan of cherries. &ldquo;Why, you can be anything at all now
you want to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billie looked at her peacefully. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d take
it like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just wanted to tell somebody
who would almost feel the way I did about it. You&rsquo;re
a swell pal, know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Billie, that&rsquo;s a real compliment. Come on
into the kitchen and I&rsquo;ll give you some gingerbread
with whipped cream on it.&rdquo; The two went into the
house together and while Billie ate, Doris listened
while he planned the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just know you&rsquo;ll succeed, Billie,&rdquo; she told him
confidently, when she said goodbye on the back steps.
&ldquo;Come down any time and we&rsquo;ll talk about it some
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca stopped by later that afternoon, chin up
and smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sound asleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now that everything&rsquo;s
kind of quieted down, I don&rsquo;t mind telling
you something. After Billie had gone, the Judge and
I talked things over and I don&rsquo;t know but what I&rsquo;ll
have to move over there and take care of the two of
them. Land knows they need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Becky, marry the Judge?&rdquo; gasped Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I might as well,&rdquo; laughed Rebecca. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
wasted thirty years now, and he&rsquo;ll fret and fuss for
thirty more if I don&rsquo;t marry him. I&rsquo;ll sell Maple Grove,
or you Craigs can have it if you like, rent free.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">20. Jean and Ralph</span></h2>
<p>The last week in July saw the end of Ralph McRae&rsquo;s
visit at Woodhow. He had been East nearly two
months and Buzzy was to go back with him. It was impossible
to measure or even to estimate Buzzy&rsquo;s inward
joy over the decision, for there had been born in him
the spirit of those who long for travel and adventure.
He had listened to the distant whistle of the trains that
slipped through the Quinnebaug valley, and longed
to be on them going anywhere at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were going too,&rdquo; said Sally. &ldquo;I wish all of
us were going. I&rsquo;d love to have a ranch out there and
work it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear child, what strange notions you do have.&rdquo;
Mrs. Hancock sighed. &ldquo;I never thought of such things
when I was your age. I wanted to be a teacher, that was
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your grandfather said I was needed at home,
and so I stayed on until I met your father when I was
eighteen. Then I married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe if he&rsquo;d let you be a teacher, you
wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to get married. I want to study
all about trees and forestry and conservation, and I
want to ride over miles and miles of forests that are
all mine. I&rsquo;m going to, too, some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you now, Sally?&rdquo; asked Ralph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically sixteen. Fifteen and a half, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe next year when I bring Buzzy home, we
can coax Aunt Luella to take a trip out with you.
How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hancock flushed delicately, and smiled up at
her tall nephew. &ldquo;How you talk, Ralph. That would
cost a sight of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell you, Aunt Luella,&rdquo; said Ralph, his
hands deep in his pockets as he leaned back against
the high mantelpiece in the living room. &ldquo;I want to
hand over Woodhow to you and the children. I
haven&rsquo;t any feeling for it like you have, and it seems
to me, after talking it over with Mr. Craig, that it
rightfully belongs to you. He&rsquo;d like to buy it, he says,
inside of two or three years. They like it over there,
and plan to stay in Elmhurst, but if you want to take
it over, I&rsquo;m willing to transfer it before I go West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph, you don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;d give up the place
yourself? Why, whatever would I do with it? I love
every inch of ground there and every blade of grass,
but you see how it is. Buzzy&rsquo;s set on going West and
Sally wants to go to college and I don&rsquo;t know what all.
I couldn&rsquo;t live on there alone, and they haven&rsquo;t got
the feeling for it that I have. The younger generation
seems to have rooted itself up out of the soil. I
wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with it after I&rsquo;d got it, and
I wouldn&rsquo;t take it away from the Craigs for anything.
Why, they love it almost as much as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Aunt Luella, but I wanted you to have the
opportunity to say yes or no,&rdquo; answered Ralph. &ldquo;Now,
then, here&rsquo;s the other way out. Supposing I make it
over to you, and you have the rental money, and then
sell it to Mr. Craig when he is able to take it over.
You&rsquo;d have the good of it then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best way, Mom,&rdquo; Sally spoke up. &ldquo;They
have all been so nice to us, and it&rsquo;s just as Ralph says.
They do love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could come back East every now and then
and visit if you did make up your mind to live out in
Saskatoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, you speak of journeying thousands of miles
as if you were driving up to Norwich. I went to Providence
once after I was married, and that&rsquo;s the only
long trip I&rsquo;ve ever made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it will take you a whole year to get ready,&rdquo;
laughed Ralph. &ldquo;Buzzy and I will be back for you and
Sally next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night before their departure Mrs. Craig gave
a dinner for them, with Rebecca and her new husband,
Judge Ellis. Ralph and Buzzy sat between Kit
and Jean at the table. Both girls were sad to think of
their friends leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to miss you, Ralph,&rdquo; said Jean rather
shyly. Her mother had told her about the new business
arrangement whereby Woodhow was to become
really their home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Ralph colored slightly. He could not bring himself
even to try and express just what it had meant to him,
this long summer visit with them. He had come East
a stranger, and had found the warmest kind of welcome
from the newcomers in the old home. He looked
around at them tonight, and thought how much he
felt at home there.</p>
<p>First, there was Mr. Craig, with his thin, scholarly
face, high forehead, and curly dark hair just touched
with gray, his keen hazel eyes behind rimless glasses,
and finely modeled chin. Then Mrs. Craig, surely the
most gracious woman he had ever known excepting
his own mother. Just the mere sound of her soft, engaging
laugh made trouble seem very unimportant.
And Kit, imperious, argumentative Kit, so full of energy
that she was like a Roman candle. He would best
remember her as she had stepped out of the shadows
into the moonlight to welcome him. Doris beamed on
him from her place across the table. To Doris he was
like a knight that had come along the highway and, if
possible, she would have had him in crimson hose and
plumed cap. And Tommy, fun-loving, constantly
chattering, full of odd knowledge that boys of eleven
seemed to pick up, and always asking questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Last of all, Ralph looked down at Jean at his side.
Jean, almost eighteen, already a replica of her mother
in her quick tenderness and her looks. His eyes lingered
on her. She was very sweet, he thought, the
sweetest of them all. He was going to miss Jean very
much.</p>
<p>Tommy trailed Ralph into the living room after
the others that evening and told him over and over
again to send him a tame bear, one that he could bring
up by hand and train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you&rsquo;ll have your hands full, Ralph,&rdquo;
Rebecca exclaimed, &ldquo;if you fill all these commissions.
I declare it seems as if you belonged to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean and Kit drove Ralph and Buzzy to the station
the next day. The boys had already made their goodbyes
to the others at home, for Mrs. Hancock had preferred
it that way. She declared she would cry at the
station and would rather say goodbye to her son and
nephew at home, where she could weep in privacy.</p>
<p>As the train puffed its way around the hillside bend
of the track, Jean remembered when she had once before
waited for the same train to arrive. The day which
now seemed so long ago, when she was meeting the
family arriving from Sandy Cove. That time she had
thought the train would never come. Now, all too fast,
it was making its way into the station.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;You promise to write to us now, Buzzy,&rdquo; reminded
Kit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back next summer, Jeannie,&rdquo; said Ralph,
looking deep into her eyes. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll be surprised
how fast the days will fly by in the meantime. Goodbye,
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye.&rdquo; Jean was suddenly overcome by the
meaning of their farewell and added, &ldquo;Oh, Ralph, I
shall miss you so very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she and Kit walked back to the car, Jean thought
over what Ralph had said last. Would the next year
go so fast as he had said? He seemed so positive. Yet
Jean wondered.</p>
<p>Jean had no need to worry. Her adventures at an
art school in New York, told in <i>JEAN CRAIG IN
NEW YORK</i> proved that Ralph was right.</p>

<br /><span class="small">BY KAY LYTTLETON</span></p>
<p>When Tom Craig came home from the Pacific,
wounded, the Craig family found there
wasn&rsquo;t enough money to maintain their
beautiful home and send Tom to the country
to regain his health. So the family moved
to a farm in Elmhurst. Lovely Jean, only
seventeen, was a staff of courage for her
family in their new life. But it wasn&rsquo;t all
hard work. There were picnics, new friends
and there was Ralph McRae, the young and
handsome landlord.</p>
<p>This is the heart-warming story of a
family who met hardship with pluck and
humor, and of Jean Craig, gay and lovable,
whose courage surmounted all obstacles.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
